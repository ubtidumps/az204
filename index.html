      You are implementing a software as a service (SaaS) ASP.NET Core web service that will run as an Azure Web App. The web service will use an on-premises
      <br/>
      SQL Server database for storage. The web service also includes a WebJob that processes data updates. Four customers will use the web service.
      <br/>
      ✑ Each instance of the WebJob processes data for a single customer and must run as a singleton instance.
      <br/>
      ✑ Each deployment must be tested by using deployment slots prior to serving production data.
      <br/>
      ✑ Azure costs must be minimized.
      <br/>
      ✑ Azure resources must be located in an isolated network.
      <br/>
      You need to configure the App Service plan for the Web App.
      <br/>
      How should you configure the App Service plan? To answer, select the appropriate settings in the answer area.

      You are a developer for a software as a service (SaaS) company that uses an Azure Function to process orders. The Azure Function currently runs on an Azure
      <br/>
      Function app that is triggered by an Azure Storage queue.

      You need to configure Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRD) for the Azure Function.
      <br/>
      Which CRDs should you configure? To answer, drag the appropriate CRD types to the correct locations. Each CRD type may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.

      You develop a software as a service (SaaS) offering to manage photographs. Users upload photos to a web service which then stores the photos in Azure
      <br/>
      Storage Blob storage. The storage account type is General-purpose V2.
      <br/>
      When photos are uploaded, they must be processed to produce and save a mobile-friendly version of the image. The process to produce a mobile-friendly version of the image must start in less than one minute.
      <br/>
      You need to design the process that starts the photo processing.
      <br/>
      Solution: Trigger the photo processing from Blob storage events.

       You need to catch the triggered event, so move the photo processing to an Azure Function triggered from the blob upload.
       <br/>
       Note: Azure Storage events allow applications to react to events. Common Blob storage event scenarios include image or video processing, search indexing, or any file-oriented workflow.
       <br/>
       Events are pushed using Azure Event Grid to subscribers such as Azure Functions, Azure Logic Apps, or even to your own http listener.
       <br/>
       However, the processing must start in less than one minute.
       <br/>
       Note: Only storage accounts of kind StorageV2 (general purpose v2) and BlobStorage support event integration. Storage (general purpose v1) does not support integration with Event Grid.

       Specify custom warm-up.
       <br/>
       Some apps might require custom warm-up actions before the swap. The applicationInitialization configuration element in web.config lets you specify custom initialization actions. The swap operation waits for this custom warm-up to finish before swapping with the target slot. Here's a sample web.config fragment.
       <br/>
       &lt;system.webServer&gt;
       <br/>
       &lt;applicationInitialization&gt;

      You develop a software as a service (SaaS) offering to manage photographs. Users upload photos to a web service which then stores the photos in Azure
      <br/>
      Storage Blob storage. The storage account type is General-purpose V2.
      <br/>
      When photos are uploaded, they must be processed to produce and save a mobile-friendly version of the image. The process to produce a mobile-friendly version of the image must start in less than one minute.
      <br/>
      You need to design the process that starts the photo processing.
      <br/>
      Solution: Convert the Azure Storage account to a BlockBlobStorage storage account.

       Not necessary to convert the account, instead move photo processing to an Azure Function triggered from the blob upload..

       Azure Storage events allow applications to react to events. Common Blob storage event scenarios include image or video processing, search indexing, or any file- oriented workflow.
       <br/>
       Note: Only storage accounts of kind StorageV2 (general purpose v2) and BlobStorage support event integration. Storage (general purpose v1) does not support integration with Event Grid.

       Accessing the client certificate from App Service.
       <br/>
       If you are using ASP.NET and configure your app to use client certificate authentication, the certificate will be available through the HttpRequest.ClientCertificate property. For other application stacks, the client cert will be available in your app through a base64 encoded value in the "X-ARR-ClientCert" request header. Your application can create a certificate from this value and then use it for authentication and authorization purposes in your application.

       You can host native Linux applications in the cloud by using Azure Web Apps. To create a Web App for Containers, you must run Azure CLI commands that create a group, then a service plan, and finally the web app itself.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Step 1: az group create -
       <br/>
       In the Cloud Shell, create a resource group with the az group create command.
       <br/>
       Step 2: az appservice plan create
       <br/>
       In the Cloud Shell, create an App Service plan in the resource group with the az appservice plan create command.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Step 3: az webapp create -
       <br/>
       In the Cloud Shell, create a web app in the myAppServicePlan App Service plan with the az webapp create command. Don't forget to replace with a unique app name, and &lt;docker-ID&gt; with your Docker ID.

      You are developing a serverless Java application on Azure. You create a new Azure Key Vault to work with secrets from a new Azure Functions application.
      <br/>
      The application must meet the following requirements:
      <br/>
      ✑ Reference the Azure Key Vault without requiring any changes to the Java code.
      <br/>
      ✑ Dynamically add and remove instances of the Azure Functions host based on the number of incoming application events.
      <br/>
      ✑ Ensure that instances are perpetually warm to avoid any cold starts.
      <br/>
      ✑ Connect to a VNet.
      <br/>
      ✑ Authentication to the Azure Key Vault instance must be removed if the Azure Function application is deleted.
      <br/>
      You need to grant the Azure Functions application access to the Azure Key Vault.
      <br/>
      Which three actions should you perform in sequence? To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of actions to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order.

       Step 1: Create the Azure Functions app with a Consumption plan type.
       <br/>
       Use the Consumption plan for serverless.

       Step 2: Create a system-assigned managed identity for the application.
       <br/>
       Create a system-assigned managed identity for your application.
       <br/>
       Key Vault references currently only support system-assigned managed identities. User-assigned identities cannot be used.

       Step 3: Create an access policy in Key Vault for the application identity.
       <br/>
       Create an access policy in Key Vault for the application identity you created earlier. Enable the "Get" secret permission on this policy. Do not configure the
       <br/>
       "authorized application" or applicationId settings, as this is not compatible with a managed identity.

       Windows Azure Web Sites (WAWS) offers 3 modes:  Standard, Free, and Shared.
       <br/>
       Standard mode carries an enterprise-grade SLA (Service Level Agreement) of 99.9% monthly, even for sites with just one instance.
       <br/>
       Standard mode runs on dedicated instances, making it different from the other ways to buy Windows Azure Web Sites.
       <br/>
       Incorrect Answers:
       <br/>
       B: Shared and Free modes do not offer the scaling flexibility of Standard, and they have some important limits.
       <br/>
       Shared mode, just as the name states, also uses shared Compute resources, and also has a CPU limit. So, while neither Free nor Shared is likely to be the best choice for your production environment due to these limits.

       Instead pass the HTTP trigger payload into an Azure Service Bus queue to be processed by a queue trigger function and return an immediate HTTP success response.
       <br/>
       Note: Large, long-running functions can cause unexpected timeout issues. General best practices include:
       <br/>
       Whenever possible, refactor large functions into smaller function sets that work together and return responses fast. For example, a webhook or HTTP trigger function might require an acknowledgment response within a certain time limit; it's common for webhooks to require an immediate response. You can pass the

       Large, long-running functions can cause unexpected timeout issues. General best practices include:
       <br/>
       Whenever possible, refactor large functions into smaller function sets that work together and return responses fast. For example, a webhook or HTTP trigger function might require an acknowledgment response within a certain time limit; it's common for webhooks to require an immediate response. You can pass the

       HTTP trigger payload into a queue to be processed by a queue trigger function. This approach lets you defer the actual work and return an immediate response.

      You develop an HTTP triggered Azure Function app to process Azure Storage blob data. The app is triggered using an output binding on the blob.
      <br/>
      The app continues to time out after four minutes. The app must process the blob data.

      You develop a software as a service (SaaS) offering to manage photographs. Users upload photos to a web service which then stores the photos in Azure
      <br/>
      Storage Blob storage. The storage account type is General-purpose V2.
      <br/>
      When photos are uploaded, they must be processed to produce and save a mobile-friendly version of the image. The process to produce a mobile-friendly version of the image must start in less than one minute.
      <br/>
      You need to design the process that starts the photo processing.
      <br/>
      Solution: Move photo processing to an Azure Function triggered from the blob upload.

       Azure Storage events allow applications to react to events. Common Blob storage event scenarios include image or video processing, search indexing, or any file- oriented workflow.
       <br/>
       Events are pushed using Azure Event Grid to subscribers such as Azure Functions, Azure Logic Apps, or even to your own http listener.
       <br/>
       Note: Only storage accounts of kind StorageV2 (general purpose v2) and BlobStorage support event integration. Storage (general purpose v1) does not support integration with Event Grid.

       Change feed support in Azure Blob Storage
       <br/>
       The purpose of the change feed is to provide transaction logs of all the changes that occur to the blobs and the blob metadata in your storage account. The change feed provides ordered, guaranteed, durable, immutable, read-only log of these changes. Client applications can read these logs at any time, either in streaming or in batch mode. The change feed enables you to build efficient and scalable solutions that process change events that occur in your Blob Storage account at a low cost.

      You are configuring a new development environment for a Java application.
      <br/>
      The environment requires a Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS), several storage accounts, and networking components.
      <br/>
      The VMSS must not be created until the storage accounts have been successfully created and an associated load balancer and virtual network is configured.

       By default, the batch size is 16. When the number being processed gets down to 8, the runtime gets another batch and starts processing those messages. So the maximum number of concurrent messages being processed per function on one virtual machine (VM) is 24.

      You are developing a solution for a hospital to support the following use cases:
      <br/>
      ✑ The most recent patient status details must be retrieved even if multiple users in different locations have updated the patient record.
      <br/>
      ✑ Patient health monitoring data retrieved must be the current version or the prior version.

       Box 1: Strong -
       <br/>
       Strong: Strong consistency offers a linearizability guarantee. The reads are guaranteed to return the most recent committed version of an item. A client never sees an uncommitted or partial write. Users are always guaranteed to read the latest committed write.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Box 2: Bounded staleness -
       <br/>
       Bounded staleness: The reads are guaranteed to honor the consistent-prefix guarantee. The reads might lag behind writes by at most "K" versions (that is
       <br/>
       "updates") of an item or by "t" time interval. When you choose bounded staleness, the "staleness" can be configured in two ways:
       <br/>
       The number of versions (K) of the item
       <br/>
       The time interval (t) by which the reads might lag behind the writes
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Box 3: Eventual -
       <br/>
       Eventual: There's no ordering guarantee for reads. In the absence of any further writes, the replicas eventually converge.
       <br/>
       Incorrect Answers:
       <br/>
       Consistent prefix: Updates that are returned contain some prefix of all the updates, with no gaps. Consistent prefix guarantees that reads never see out-of-order writes.

       A: In Azure, you can run your functions directly from a deployment package file in your function app. The other option is to deploy your files in the d:\home\site
       <br/>
       \wwwroot directory of your function app (see A above).
       <br/>
       To enable your function app to run from a package, you just add a WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE setting to your function app settings.
       <br/>
       Note: The host.json metadata file contains global configuration options that affect all functions for a function app.
       <br/>
       D: To customize your deployment, include a .deployment file in the repository root.
       <br/>
       You just need to add a file to the root of your repository with the name .deployment and the content:
       <br/>
       [config]
       <br/>
       command = YOUR COMMAND TO RUN FOR DEPLOYMENT
       <br/>
       this command can be just running a script (batch file) that has all that is required for your deployment, like copying files from the repository to the web root directory for example.

       To move a storage account, create a copy of your storage account in another region. Then, move your data to that account by using AzCopy, or another tool of your choice.
       <br/>
       The steps are:
       <br/>
       ✑ Export a template.
       <br/>
       ✑ Modify the template by adding the target region and storage account name.
       <br/>
       ✑ Deploy the template to create the new storage account.
       <br/>
       ✑ Configure the new storage account.
       <br/>
       ✑ Move data to the new storage account.
       <br/>
       ✑ Delete the resources in the source region.
       <br/>
       Note: You must enable the change feed on your storage account to begin capturing and recording changes. You can enable and disable changes by using Azure
       <br/>
       Resource Manager templates on Portal or Powershell.

      You develop a software as a service (SaaS) offering to manage photographs. Users upload photos to a web service which then stores the photos in Azure
      <br/>
      Storage Blob storage. The storage account type is General-purpose V2.
      <br/>
      When photos are uploaded, they must be processed to produce and save a mobile-friendly version of the image. The process to produce a mobile-friendly version of the image must start in less than one minute.
      <br/>
      You need to design the process that starts the photo processing.
      <br/>
      Solution: Create an Azure Function app that uses the Consumption hosting model and that is triggered from the blob upload.

       These are valid warm-up behavior options, but are not helpful in fixing swap problems.
       <br/>
       Instead update the web.config file to include the applicationInitialization configuration element. Specify custom initialization actions to run the scripts.
       <br/>
       Note: Some apps might require custom warm-up actions before the swap. The applicationInitialization configuration element in web.config lets you specify custom initialization actions. The swap operation waits for this custom warm-up to finish before swapping with the target slot. Here's a sample web.config fragment.
       <br/>
       &lt;system.webServer&gt;
       <br/>

       Box 1: Custom handler -
       <br/>
       Custom handlers can be used to create functions in any language or runtime by running an HTTP server process, for example Go or Rust.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Box 2: Trigger -
       <br/>
       Functions are invoked by a trigger and can have exactly one. In addition to invoking the function, certain triggers also serve as bindings. You may also define multiple bindings in addition to the trigger. Bindings provide a declarative way to connect data to your code.

       The ability to derive the host name from the IP or FQDN of the back-end pool members. HTTP settings also provide an option to dynamically pick the host name from a back-end pool member's FQDN if configured with the option to derive host name from an individual back-end pool member.

       A (not C): SSL termination and end to end SSL with multi-tenant services.

       The archive access tier has the lowest storage cost. But it has higher data retrieval costs compared to the hot and cool tiers. Data in the archive tier can take several hours to retrieve depending on the priority of the rehydration. For small objects, a high priority rehydrate may retrieve the object from archive in under 1 hour.

      You are developing a ticket reservation system for an airline.
      <br/>
      The storage solution for the application must meet the following requirements:
      <br/>
      ✑ Ensure at least 99.99% availability and provide low latency.
      <br/>
      ✑ Accept reservations even when localized network outages or other unforeseen failures occur.
      <br/>
      ✑ Process reservations in the exact sequence as reservations are submitted to minimize overbooking or selling the same seat to multiple travelers.
      <br/>
      ✑ Allow simultaneous and out-of-order reservations with a maximum five-second tolerance window.
      <br/>
      You provision a resource group named airlineResourceGroup in the Azure South-Central US region.
      <br/>
      You need to provision a SQL API Cosmos DB account to support the app.

       Box 1: BoundedStaleness -

       Bounded staleness: The reads are guaranteed to honor the consistent-prefix guarantee. The reads might lag behind writes by at most "K" versions (that is,
       <br/>
       "updates") of an item or by "T" time interval. In other words, when you choose bounded staleness, the "staleness" can be configured in two ways:
       <br/>
       The number of versions (K) of the item
       <br/>
       The time interval (T) by which the reads might lag behind the writes

       <br/>
       <br/>
       Strong -
       <br/>
       Strong consistency offers a linearizability guarantee. Linearizability refers to serving requests concurrently. The reads are guaranteed to return the most recent committed version of an item. A client never sees an uncommitted or partial write. Users are always guaranteed to read the latest committed write.
       <br/>
       Box 2: --enable-automatic-failover true\
       <br/>
       For multi-region Cosmos accounts that are configured with a single-write region, enable automatic-failover by using Azure CLI or Azure portal. After you enable automatic failover, whenever there is a regional disaster, Cosmos DB will automatically failover your account.

      You are developing an Azure solution to collect point-of-sale (POS) device data from 2,000 stores located throughout the world. A single device can produce
      <br/>
      2 megabytes (MB) of data every 24 hours. Each store location has one to five devices that send data.
      <br/>
      You must store the device data in Azure Blob storage. Device data must be correlated based on a device identifier. Additional stores are expected to open in the future.
      <br/>
      You need to implement a solution to receive the device data.
      <br/>
      Solution: Provision an Azure Event Grid. Configure the machine identifier as the partition key and enable capture.
      <br/>
      Does the solution meet the goal?

      Data newer than three months must be available immediately. Data older than a year must be saved but does not need to be available immediately.

      You need to configure the account to support a lifecycle management rule that moves blob data to archive storage for data not modified in the last year.

       Step 1: Upgrade the storage account to GPv2
       <br/>
       Object storage data tiering between hot, cool, and archive is supported in Blob Storage and General Purpose v2 (GPv2) accounts. General Purpose v1 (GPv1) accounts don't support tiering.
       <br/>
       You can easily convert your existing GPv1 or Blob Storage accounts to GPv2 accounts through the Azure portal.
       <br/>
       Step 2: Copy the data to be archived to a Standard GPv2 storage account and then delete the data from the original storage account
       <br/>
       Step 3: Change the storage account access tier from hot to cool
       <br/>
       Note: Hot - Optimized for storing data that is accessed frequently.
       <br/>
       Cool - Optimized for storing data that is infrequently accessed and stored for at least 30 days.
       <br/>
       Archive - Optimized for storing data that is rarely accessed and stored for at least 180 days with flexible latency requirements, on the order of hours.
       <br/>
       Only the hot and cool access tiers can be set at the account level. The archive access tier can only be set at the blob level.

       SQL Filter: SQL Filters - A SqlFilter holds a SQL-like conditional expression that is evaluated in the broker against the arriving messages' user-defined properties and system properties. All system properties must be prefixed with sys. in the conditional expression. The SQL-language subset for filter conditions tests for the existence of properties (EXISTS), as well as for null-values (IS NULL), logical NOT/AND/OR, relational operators, simple numeric arithmetic, and simple text pattern matching with LIKE.
       <br/>
       Correlation Filters - A CorrelationFilter holds a set of conditions that are matched against one or more of an arriving message's user and system properties. A common use is to match against the CorrelationId property, but the application can also choose to match against ContentType, Label, MessageId, ReplyTo,
       <br/>
       ReplyToSessionId, SessionId, To, and any user-defined properties. A match exists when an arriving message's value for a property is equal to the value specified in the correlation filter. For string expressions, the comparison is case-sensitive. When specifying multiple match properties, the filter combines them as a logical
       <br/>
       AND condition, meaning for the filter to match, all conditions must match.
       <br/>
       Boolean filters - The TrueFilter and FalseFilter either cause all arriving messages (true) or none of the arriving messages (false) to be selected for the subscription.

       Step 1: A user requests the image..
       <br/>
       A user requests a file (also called an asset) by using a URL with a special domain name, such as &lt;endpoint name&gt;.azureedge.net. This name can be an endpoint hostname or a custom domain. The DNS routes the request to the best performing POP location, which is usually the POP that is geographically closest to the user.
       <br/>
       Step 2:  If no edge servers in the POP have the..
       <br/>
       If no edge servers in the POP have the file in their cache, the POP requests the file from the origin server. The origin server can be an Azure Web App, Azure
       <br/>
       Cloud Service, Azure Storage account, or any publicly accessible web server.
       <br/>
       Step 3: The origin server returns the..
       <br/>
       The origin server returns the file to an edge server in the POP.
       <br/>
       An edge server in the POP caches the file and returns the file to the original requestor (Alice). The file remains cached on the edge server in the POP until the time-to-live (TTL) specified by its HTTP headers expires. If the origin server didn't specify a TTL, the default TTL is seven days.
       <br/>
       Step 4: Subsequent requests for..
       <br/>
       Additional users can then request the same file by using the same URL that the original user used, and can also be directed to the same POP.
       <br/>
       If the TTL for the file hasn't expired, the POP edge server returns the file directly from the cache. This process results in a faster, more responsive user experience.

      You are developing an Azure Cosmos DB solution by using the Azure Cosmos DB SQL API. The data includes millions of documents. Each document may contain hundreds of properties.
      <br/>
      The properties of the documents do not contain distinct values for partitioning. Azure Cosmos DB must scale individual containers in the database to meet the performance needs of the application by spreading the workload evenly across all partitions over time.
      <br/>
      You need to select a partition key.

      Which two partition keys can you use? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.

       You can form a partition key by concatenating multiple property values into a single artificial partitionKey property. These keys are referred to as synthetic keys.
       <br/>
       Another possible strategy to distribute the workload more evenly is to append a random number at the end of the partition key value. When you distribute items in this way, you can perform parallel write operations across partitions.
       <br/>
       Note: It's the best practice to have a partition key with many distinct values, such as hundreds or thousands. The goal is to distribute your data and workload evenly across the items associated with these partition key values. If such a property doesnג€™t exist in your data, you can construct a synthetic partition key.

       Azure Cosmos DB now provides a new RBAC role, Cosmos DB Operator. This new role lets you provision Azure Cosmos accounts, databases, and containers, but canג€™t access the keys that are required to access the data. This role is intended for use in scenarios where the ability to grant access to Azure Active Directory service principals to manage deployment operations for Cosmos DB is needed, including the account, database, and containers.

       1. Go to Azure Active Directory to configure the Manifest.  Click on Azure Active Directory, and go to App registrations to find your application:
       <br/>
       2. Click on your application (or search for it if you have a lot of apps) and edit the Manifest by clicking on it.
       <br/>
       3. Locate the ג€groupMembershipClaimsג€ setting. Set its value to either ג€SecurityGroupג€ or ג€Allג€.  To help you decide which:
       <br/>
       ✑ ג€SecurityGroupג€ - groups claim will contain the identifiers of all security groups of which the user is a member.
       <br/>
       ✑ ג€Allג€ - groups claim will contain the identifiers of all security groups and all distribution lists of which the user is a member

      You are developing an application to securely transfer data between on-premises file systems and Azure Blob storage. The application stores keys, secrets, and certificates in Azure Key Vault. The application uses the Azure Key Vault APIs.
      <br/>
      The application must allow recovery of an accidental deletion of the key vault or key vault objects. Key vault objects must be retained for 90 days after deletion.
      <br/>
      You need to protect the key vault and key vault objects.

      Which Azure Key Vault feature should you use? To answer, drag the appropriate features to the correct actions. Each feature may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.

       Box 1: Soft delete -
       <br/>
       When soft-delete is enabled, resources marked as deleted resources are retained for a specified period (90 days by default). The service further provides a mechanism for recovering the deleted object, essentially undoing the deletion.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Box 2: Purge protection -
       <br/>
       Purge protection is an optional Key Vault behavior and is not enabled by default. Purge protection can only be enabled once soft-delete is enabled.
       <br/>
       When purge protection is on, a vault or an object in the deleted state cannot be purged until the retention period has passed. Soft-deleted vaults and objects can still be recovered, ensuring that the retention policy will be followed.

      You are developing an ASP.NET Core website that can be used to manage photographs which are stored in Azure Blob Storage containers.
      <br/>
      Users of the website authenticate by using their Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) credentials.
      <br/>
      You implement role-based access control (RBAC) role permissions on the containers that store photographs. You assign users to RBAC roles.
      <br/>
      You need to configure the website's Azure AD Application so that user's permissions can be used with the Azure Blob containers.
      <br/>
      How should you configure the application? To answer, drag the appropriate setting to the correct location. Each setting can be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.
      <br/>
      NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

       Box 1: keyvault -
       <br/>
       Create an Azure Key Vault with az keyvault create and enable the Key Vault for use with disk encryption. Specify a unique Key Vault name for keyvault_name as follows: keyvault_name=myvaultname$RANDOM az keyvault create \
       <br/>
       --name $keyvault_name \
       <br/>
       --resource-group $resourcegroup \
       <br/>
       --location eastus \
       <br/>
       --enabled-for-disk-encryption True
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Box 2: keyvault key -
       <br/>
       The Azure platform needs to be granted access to request the cryptographic keys when the VM boots to decrypt the virtual disks. Create a cryptographic key in your Key Vault with az keyvault key create. The following example creates a key named myKey: az keyvault key create \
       <br/>
       --vault-name $keyvault_name \
       <br/>
       --name myKey \
       <br/>
       --protection software
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Box 3: vm -
       <br/>
       Create a VM with az vm create. Only certain marketplace images support disk encryption. The following example creates a VM named myVM using an Ubuntu
       <br/>
       16.04 LTS image:
       <br/>
       az vm create \
       <br/>
       --resource-group $resourcegroup \
       <br/>
       --name myVM \
       <br/>
       --image Canonical:UbuntuServer:16.04-LTS:latest \
       <br/>
       --admin-username azureuser \
       <br/>
       --generate-ssh-keys \
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Box 4: vm encryption -
       <br/>
       Encrypt your VM with az vm encryption enable:
       <br/>
       az vm encryption enable \
       <br/>
       --resource-group $resourcegroup \
       <br/>
       --name myVM \
       <br/>
       --disk-encryption-keyvault $keyvault_name \
       <br/>
       --key-encryption-key myKey \
       <br/>
       --volume-type all
       <br/>
       Note: seems to an error in the question. Should have  enable instead of create.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Box 5: all -
       <br/>
       Encrypt both data and operating system.

       Azure Active Directory Managed Service Identity (MSI) gives your code an automatically managed identity for authenticating to Azure services, so that you can keep credentials out of your code.
       <br/>
       Note: Use the authentication-managed-identity policy to authenticate with a backend service using the managed identity. This policy essentially uses the managed identity to obtain an access token from Azure Active Directory for accessing the specified resource. After successfully obtaining the token, the policy will set the value of the token in the Authorization header using the Bearer scheme.
       <br/>
       Incorrect Answers:
       <br/>
       A: Use the authentication-basic policy to authenticate with a backend service using Basic authentication. This policy effectively sets the HTTP Authorization header to the value corresponding to the credentials provided in the policy.
       <br/>
       B: Anonymous is no authentication at all.
       <br/>
       D: Your code needs credentials to authenticate to cloud services, but you want to limit the visibility of those credentials as much as possible. Ideally, they never appear on a developerג€™s workstation or get checked-in to source control. Azure Key Vault can store credentials securely so they arenג€™t in your code, but to retrieve them you need to authenticate to Azure Key Vault. To authenticate to Key Vault, you need a credential! A classic bootstrap problem.

       Step 1: Get-AzSubscription -
       <br/>
       If you have multiple subscriptions, you might have to specify the one that was used to create your key vault. Enter the following to see the subscriptions for your account:
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Get-AzSubscription -
       <br/>
       Step 2: Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId
       <br/>
       To specify the subscription that's associated with the key vault you'll be logging, enter:
       <br/>
       Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId &lt;subscriptionID&gt;
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Step 3: Get-AzStorageAccountKey -
       <br/>
       You must get that storage account key.
       <br/>
       Step 4: $secretvalue = ConvertTo-SecureString &lt;storageAccountKey&gt; -AsPlainText -Force
       <br/>
       Set-AzKeyVaultSecret -VaultName &lt;vaultName&gt; -Name &lt;secretName&gt; -SecretValue $secretvalue
       <br/>
       After retrieving your secret (in this case, your storage account key), you must convert that key to a secure string, and then create a secret with that value in your key vault.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Step 5: Get-AzKeyVaultSecret -
       <br/>
       Next, get the URI for the secret you created. You'll need this URI in a later step to call the key vault and retrieve your secret. Run the following PowerShell command and make note of the ID value, which is the secret's URI:
       <br/>
       Get-AzKeyVaultSecret ג€"VaultName &lt;vaultName&gt;

       Use the authentication-managed-identity policy to authenticate with a backend service using the managed identity of the API Management service. This policy essentially uses the managed identity to obtain an access token from Azure Active Directory for accessing the specified resource. After successfully obtaining the token, the policy will set the value of the token in the Authorization header using the Bearer scheme.

       A: The jsonp policy adds JSON with padding (JSONP) support to an operation or an API to allow cross-domain calls from JavaScript browser-based clients.
       <br/>
       JSONP is a method used in JavaScript programs to request data from a server in a different domain. JSONP bypasses the limitation enforced by most web browsers where access to web pages must be in the same domain.

      DRAG DROP -
      <br/>
      Contoso, Ltd. provides an API to customers by using Azure API Management (APIM). The API authorizes users with a JWT token.
      <br/>
      You must implement response caching for the APIM gateway. The caching mechanism must detect the user ID of the client that accesses data for a given location and cache the response for that user ID.
      <br/>
      You need to add the following policies to the policies file:
      <br/>
      ✑ a set-variable policy to store the detected user identity
      <br/>
      ✑ a cache-lookup-value policy
      <br/>
      ✑ a cache-store-value policy
      <br/>
      ✑ a find-and-replace policy to update the response body with the user profile information
      <br/>
      To which policy section should you add the policies? To answer, drag the appropriate sections to the correct policies. Each section may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.

       A: You can use the Azure AD REST APIs in Microsoft Graph to create unique workflows between Azure AD resources and third-party services.
       <br/>
       Enterprise developers use Microsoft Graph to integrate Azure AD identity management and other services to automate administrative workflows, such as employee onboarding (and termination), profile maintenance, license deployment, and more.

       A: Revoke a user delegation SAS -
       <br/>
       To revoke a user delegation SAS from the Azure CLI, call the az storage account revoke-delegation-keys command. This command revokes all of the user delegation keys associated with the specified storage account. Any shared access signatures associated with those keys are invalidated.
       <br/>
       B: To revoke a stored access policy, you can either delete it, or rename it by changing the signed identifier. Changing the signed identifier breaks the associations between any existing signatures and the stored access policy. Deleting or renaming the stored access policy immediately effects all of the shared access signatures associated with it.

       To give a managed identity access to an Azure resource, you need to add a role to the target resource for that identity.
       <br/>
       Note: To easily authenticate access to other resources that are protected by Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) without having to sign in and provide credentials or secrets, your logic app can use a managed identity (formerly known as Managed Service Identity or MSI). Azure manages this identity for you and helps secure your credentials because you don't have to provide or rotate secrets.
       <br/>
       If you set up your logic app to use the system-assigned identity or a manually created, user-assigned identity, the function in your logic app can also use that same identity for authentication.

       Azure Functions is the simplest option if you are just getting started using the change feed. Due to its simplicity, it is also the recommended option for most change feed use cases. When you create an Azure Functions trigger for Azure Cosmos DB, you select the container to connect, and the Azure Function gets triggered whenever there is a change in the container. Because Azure Functions uses the change feed processor behind the scenes, it automatically parallelizes change processing across your container's partitions.
       <br/>
       Note: You can work with change feed using the following options:
       <br/>
       ✑ Using change feed with Azure Functions

      You have an Azure Web app that uses Cosmos DB as a data store. You create a CosmosDB container by running the following PowerShell script:
      <br/>
      $resourceGroupName = "testResourceGroup"
      <br/>
      $accountName = "testCosmosAccount"
      <br/>
      $databaseName = "testDatabase"
      <br/>
      $containerName = "testContainer"
      <br/>
      $partitionKeyPath = "/EmployeeId"
      <br/>
      $autoscaleMaxThroughput = 5000
      <br/>
      <br/>
      New-AzCosmosDBSqlContainer -
      <br/>
      -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName
      <br/>
      -AccountName $accountName
      <br/>
      -DatabaseName $databaseName
      <br/>
      -Name $containerName

      <br/>
      -PartitionKeyPath $partitionKeyPath
      <br/>
      -AutoscaleMaxThroughput $autoscaleMaxThroughput
      <br/>
      You create the following queries that target the container:
      <br/>
      SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.EmployeeId &gt; '12345'
      <br/>
      SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.UserID = '12345'

       Box 1: No -
       <br/>
       You set the highest, or maximum RU/s Tmax you don't want the system to exceed. The system automatically scales the throughput T such that 0.1* Tmax &lt;= T &lt;=
       <br/>
       Tmax.
       <br/>
       In this example we have autoscaleMaxThroughput = 5000, so the minimum throughput for the container is 500 R/Us.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Box 2: No -
       <br/>
       First query: SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.EmployeeId &gt; '12345'
       <br/>
       Here's a query that has a range filter on the partition key and won't be scoped to a single physical partition. In order to be an in-partition query, the query must have an equality filter that includes the partition key:
       <br/>
       SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.DeviceId &gt; 'XMS-0001'
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Box 3: Yes -
       <br/>
       Example of In-partition query:
       <br/>
       Consider the below query with an equality filter on DeviceId. If we run this query on a container partitioned on DeviceId, this query will filter to a single physical partition.
       <br/>
       SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.DeviceId = 'XMS-0001'

       Set if missing: Honor origin-provided cache-directive headers, if they exist; otherwise, use the provided cache duration.
       <br/>
       Incorrect:
       <br/>
       Bypass cache: Do not cache and ignore origin-provided cache-directive headers.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Box 2: 1 hour -
       <br/>
       All media content must expire from the cache after one hour.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Box 3: Cache every unique URL -
       <br/>
       Cache every unique URL: In this mode, each request with a unique URL, including the query string, is treated as a unique asset with its own cache. For example, the response from the origin server for a request for example.ashx?q=test1 is cached at the POP node and returned for subsequent caches with the same query string. A request for example.ashx?q=test2 is cached as a separate asset with its own time-to-live setting.
       <br/>
       Incorrect Answers:
       <br/>
       Bypass caching for query strings: In this mode, requests with query strings are not cached at the CDN POP node. The POP node retrieves the asset directly from the origin server and passes it to the requestor with each request.
       <br/>
       Ignore query strings: Default mode. In this mode, the CDN point-of-presence (POP) node passes the query strings from the requestor to the origin server on the first request and caches the asset. All subsequent requests for the asset that are served from the POP ignore the query strings until the cached asset expires.

       Box 1: Users -
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Box 2:  Impact -
       <br/>
       One way to think of Impact is as the ultimate tool for settling arguments with someone on your team about how slowness in some aspect of your site is affecting whether users stick around. While users may tolerate a certain amount of slowness, Impact gives you insight into how best to balance optimization and performance to maximize user conversion.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Box 3: Retention -
       <br/>
       The retention feature in Azure Application Insights helps you analyze how many users return to your app, and how often they perform particular tasks or achieve goals. For example, if you run a game site, you could compare the numbers of users who return to the site after losing a game with the number who return after winning. This knowledge can help you improve both your user experience and your business strategy.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Box 4: User flows -
       <br/>
       The User Flows tool visualizes how users navigate between the pages and features of your site. It's great for answering questions like:
       <br/>
       ✑ How do users navigate away from a page on your site?
       <br/>
       ✑ What do users click on a page on your site?
       <br/>
       ✑ Where are the places that users churn most from your site?

       Funnel: If your application involves multiple stages, you need to know if most customers are progressing through the entire process, or if they are ending the process at some point. The progression through a series of steps in a web application is known as a funnel. You can use Azure Application Insights Funnels to gain insights into your users, and monitor step-by-step conversion rates.

       With the Premium plan the max outbound connections per instance is unbounded compared to the 600 active (1200 total) in a Consumption plan.
       <br/>
       Note: The number of available connections is limited partly because a function app runs in a sandbox environment. One of the restrictions that the sandbox imposes on your code is a limit on the number of outbound connections, which is currently 600 active (1,200 total) connections per instance. When you reach this limit, the functions runtime writes the following message to the logs: Host thresholds exceeded: Connections.

       The session state provider for Azure Cache for Redis enables you to share session information between different instances of an ASP.NET web application.
       <br/>
       The same connection can be used by multiple concurrent threads.
       <br/>
       Redis supports both read and write operations.
       <br/>
       The output cache provider for Azure Cache for Redis enables you to save the HTTP responses generated by an ASP.NET web application.
       <br/>
       Note: Using the Azure portal, you can also configure the eviction policy of the cache, and control access to the cache by adding users to the roles provided. These roles, which define the operations that members can perform, include Owner, Contributor, and Reader. For example, members of the Owner role have complete control over the cache (including security) and its contents, members of the Contributor role can read and write information in the cache, and members of the
       <br/>
       Reader role can only retrieve data from the cache.

       You can create an Azure Function with TrackAvailability() that will run periodically according to the configuration given in TimerTrigger function with your own business logic. The results of this test will be sent to your Application Insights resource, where you will be able to query for and alert on the availability results data.
       <br/>
       This allows you to create customized tests similar to what you can do via Availability Monitoring in the portal. Customized tests will allow you to write more complex availability tests than is possible using the portal UI, monitor an app inside of your Azure VNET, change the endpoint address, or create an availability test even if this feature is not available in your region.

       Box 1: Reoccurance..
       <br/>
       To regularly run tasks, processes, or jobs on specific schedule, you can start your logic app workflow with the built-in Recurrence - Schedule trigger. You can set a date and time as well as a time zone for starting the workflow and a recurrence for repeating that workflow.
       <br/>
       Set the interval and frequency for the recurrence. In this example, set these properties to run your workflow every week.

      You are developing an Azure Service application that processes queue data when it receives a message from a mobile application. Messages may not be sent to the service consistently.
      <br/>
      You have the following requirements:
      <br/>
      ✑ Queue size must not grow larger than 80 gigabytes (GB).
      <br/>
      ✑ Use first-in-first-out (FIFO) ordering of messages.
      <br/>
      ✑ Minimize Azure costs.
      <br/>
      You need to implement the messaging solution.
      <br/>
      Solution: Use the .Net API to add a message to an Azure Service Bus Queue from the mobile application. Create an Azure Function App that uses an Azure
      <br/>
      Service Bus Queue trigger.
      <br/>
      Does the solution meet the goal?

      You develop software solutions for a mobile delivery service. You are developing a mobile app that users can use to order from a restaurant in their area. The app uses the following workflow:
      <br/>
      1. A driver selects the restaurants for which they will deliver orders.
      <br/>
      2. Orders are sent to all available drivers in an area.
      <br/>
      3. Only orders for the selected restaurants will appear for the driver.
      <br/>
      4. The first driver to accept an order removes it from the list of available orders.
      <br/>
      You need to implement an Azure Service Bus solution.

       The Azure Service Bus Queue and Topic has duplicate detection.
       <br/>
       Enabling duplicate detection helps keep track of the application-controlled MessageId of all messages sent into a queue or topic during a specified time window.
       <br/>
       Incorrect Answers:
       <br/>
       C: There is just no mechanism that can query a Storage queue and find out if a message with the same contents is already there or was there before.

       Box 1: SAS tokens -
       <br/>
       Custom topics use either Shared Access Signature (SAS) or key authentication. Microsoft recommends SAS, but key authentication provides simple programming, and is compatible with many existing webhook publishers.
       <br/>
       In this case we need the expiration time provided by SAS tokens.

       <br/>
       Box 2: ValidationCode handshake -
       <br/>
       Event Grid supports two ways of validating the subscription: ValidationCode handshake (programmatic) and ValidationURL handshake (manual).
       <br/>
       If you control the source code for your endpoint, this method is recommended.
       <br/>
       Incorrect Answers:
       <br/>
       ValidationURL handshake (manual): In certain cases, you can't access the source code of the endpoint to implement the ValidationCode handshake. For example, if you use a third-party service (like Zapier or IFTTT), you can't programmatically respond with the validation code.

       It is strongly recommended to use available messaging products and services that support a publish-subscribe model, rather than building your own. In Azure, consider using Service Bus or Event Grid. Other technologies that can be used for pub/sub messaging include Redis, RabbitMQ, and Apache Kafka.

      You are developing an Azure Service application that processes queue data when it receives a message from a mobile application. Messages may not be sent to the service consistently.
      <br/>
      You have the following requirements:
      <br/>
      ✑ Queue size must not grow larger than 80 gigabytes (GB).
      <br/>
      ✑ Use first-in-first-out (FIFO) ordering of messages.
      <br/>
      ✑ Minimize Azure costs.
      <br/>
      You need to implement the messaging solution.
      <br/>
      Solution: Use the .Net API to add a message to an Azure Storage Queue from the mobile application. Create an Azure VM that is triggered from Azure Storage
      <br/>
      Queue events.
      <br/>
      Does the solution meet the goal?

      You are developing an Azure Service application that processes queue data when it receives a message from a mobile application. Messages may not be sent to the service consistently.
      <br/>
      You have the following requirements:
      <br/>
      ✑ Queue size must not grow larger than 80 gigabytes (GB).
      <br/>
      ✑ Use first-in-first-out (FIFO) ordering of messages.
      <br/>
      ✑ Minimize Azure costs.
      <br/>
      You need to implement the messaging solution.
      <br/>
      Solution: Use the .Net API to add a message to an Azure Service Bus Queue from the mobile application. Create an Azure Windows VM that is triggered from
      <br/>
      Azure Service Bus Queue.
      <br/>
      Does the solution meet the goal?

      You are developing a REST web service. Customers will access the service by using an Azure API Management instance.
      <br/>
      The web service does not correctly handle conflicts. Instead of returning an HTTP status code of 409, the service returns a status code of 500. The body of the status message contains only the word conflict.
      <br/>
      You need to ensure that conflicts produce the correct response.

      How should you complete the policy? To answer, drag the appropriate code segments to the correct locations. Each code segment may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.

       Box 1: on-error -
       <br/>
       Policies in Azure API Management are divided into inbound, backend, outbound, and on-error.
       <br/>
       If there is no on-error section, callers will receive 400 or 500 HTTP response messages if an error condition occurs.

      You are developing an Azure solution to collect point-of-sale (POS) device data from 2,000 stores located throughout the world. A single device can produce
      <br/>
      2 megabytes (MB) of data every 24 hours. Each store location has one to five devices that send data.
      <br/>
      You must store the device data in Azure Blob storage. Device data must be correlated based on a device identifier. Additional stores are expected to open in the future.
      <br/>
      You need to implement a solution to receive the device data.
      <br/>
      Solution: Provision an Azure Event Hub. Configure the machine identifier as the partition key and enable capture.

       Box 1: Azure Event Grid -
       <br/>
       Blob storage events are pushed using Azure Event Grid to subscribers such as Azure Functions, Azure Logic Apps, or even to your own http listener. Event Grid provides reliable event delivery to your applications through rich retry policies and dead-lettering.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Box 2: Azure Logic App -
       <br/>
       Event Grid uses event subscriptions to route event messages to subscribers. This image illustrates the relationship between event publishers, event subscriptions, and event handlers.

       <br/>
       Box 3: Azure Service Bus -
       <br/>
       The Event Grid service doesn't store events. Instead, events are stored in the Event Handlers, including ServiceBus, EventHubs, Storage Queue, WebHook endpoint, or many other supported Azure Services.

       Each virtual machine in your availability set is assigned an update domain and a fault domain by the underlying Azure platform. For a given availability set, five non-user-configurable update domains are assigned by default (Resource Manager deployments can then be increased to provide up to 20 update domains) to indicate groups of virtual machines and underlying physical hardware that can be rebooted at the same time.

       Azure AD can be the initial Azure AD managed domain. Azure AD can also be an on-premises Active Directory Domain Services that is federated with the Azure
       <br/>
       AD.
       <br/>
       Using an Azure AD identity to connect using SSMS or SSDT
       <br/>
       The following procedures show you how to connect to a SQL database with an Azure AD identity using SQL Server Management Studio or SQL Server Database
       <br/>
       Tools.
       <br/>
       Active Directory integrated authentication
       <br/>
       Use this method if you are logged in to Windows using your Azure Active Directory credentials from a federated domain.
       <br/>
       1. Start Management Studio or Data Tools and in the Connect to Server (or Connect to Database Engine) dialog box, in the Authentication box, select Active
       <br/>
       Directory - Integrated. No password is needed or can be entered because your existing credentials will be presented for the connection.
       <br/>

       <br/>
       2. Select the Options button, and on the Connection Properties page, in the Connect to database box, type the name of the user database you want to connect to.
       <br/>
       (The AD domain name or tenant IDג€ option is only supported for Universal with MFA connection options, otherwise it is greyed out.)

       When soft-delete is enabled, resources marked as deleted resources are retained for a specified period (90 days by default). The service further provides a mechanism for recovering the deleted object, essentially undoing the deletion.
       <br/>
       Purge protection is an optional Key Vault behavior and is not enabled by default. Purge protection can only be enabled once soft-delete is enabled.
       <br/>
       When purge protection is on, a vault or an object in the deleted state cannot be purged until the retention period has passed. Soft-deleted vaults and objects can still be recovered, ensuring that the retention policy will be followed.
       <br/>
       The default retention period is 90 days, but it is possible to set the retention policy interval to a value from 7 to 90 days through the Azure portal. Once the retention policy interval is set and saved it cannot be changed for that vault.

      Your company's Azure subscription includes an Azure Log Analytics workspace.
      <br/>
      Your company has a hundred on-premises servers that run either Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows Server 2016, and is linked to the Azure Log Analytics workspace. The Azure Log Analytics workspace is set up to gather performance counters associated with security from these linked servers.
      <br/>
      You must configure alerts based on the information gathered by the Azure Log Analytics workspace.
      <br/>
      You have to make sure that alert rules allow for dimensions, and that alert creation time should be kept to a minimum. Furthermore, a single alert notification must be created when the alert is created and when the alert is resolved.
      <br/>
      You need to make use of the necessary signal type when creating the alert rules.

       The SearchParameters.QueryType Property gets or sets a value that specifies the syntax of the search query. The default is 'simple'. Use 'full' if your query uses the Lucene query syntax.
       <br/>
       You can write queries against Azure Search based on the rich Lucene Query Parser syntax for specialized query forms: wildcard, fuzzy search, proximity search, regular expressions are a few examples.

       1. The index needs to be populated. To do this, we will need a SearchIndexClient. There are two ways to obtain one: by constructing it, or by calling
       <br/>
       Indexes.GetClient on the SearchServiceClient. Here we will use the first method.
       <br/>
       2. Create the indexBatch with the documents
       <br/>
       Something like:
       <br/>
       var hotels = new Hotel[];
       <br/>
       {
       <br/>
       new Hotel()
       <br/>
       {
       <br/>
       HotelId = "3",
       <br/>
       BaseRate = 129.99,
       <br/>
       Description = "Close to town hall and the river"
       <br/>
       }
       <br/>
       };
       <br/>
       ג€¦
       <br/>
       var batch = IndexBatch.Upload(hotels);
       <br/>
       3. The next step is to populate the newly-created index
       <br/>
       Example:
       <br/>
       var batch = IndexBatch.Upload(hotels);
       <br/>
       try
       <br/>
       {
       <br/>
       indexClient.Documents.Index(batch);
       <br/>
       }

      Current environment -
      <br/>
      Windows Server 2016 virtual machine
      <br/>
      This virtual machine (VM) runs BizTalk Server 2016. The VM runs the following workflows:
      <br/>
      Ocean Transport `" This workflow gathers and validates container information including container contents and arrival notices at various shipping ports.
      <br/>
      Inland Transport `" This workflow gathers and validates trucking information including fuel usage, number of stops, and routes.
      <br/>
      The VM supports the following REST API calls:
      <br/>
      Container API `" This API provides container information including weight, contents, and other attributes.
      <br/>
      Location API `" This API provides location information regarding shipping ports of call and trucking stops.
      <br/>
      Shipping REST API `" This API provides shipping information for use and display on the shipping website.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Shipping Data -
      <br/>
      The application uses MongoDB JSON document storage database for all container and transport information.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Shipping Web Site -
      <br/>
      The site displays shipping container tracking information and container contents. The site is located at http://shipping.wideworldimporters.com/
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Proposed solution -
      <br/>
      The on-premises shipping application must be moved to Azure. The VM has been migrated to a new Standard_D16s_v3 Azure VM by using Azure Site Recovery and must remain running in Azure to complete the BizTalk component migrations. You create a Standard_D16s_v3 Azure VM to host BizTalk Server. The Azure architecture diagram for the proposed solution is shown below:

       Optimization: Dynamic site acceleration
       <br/>
       Dynamic site acceleration (DSA) is available for Azure CDN Standard from Akamai, Azure CDN Standard from Verizon, and Azure CDN Premium from Verizon profiles.
       <br/>
       DSA includes various techniques that benefit the latency and performance of dynamic content. Techniques include route and network optimization, TCP optimization, and more.
       <br/>
       You can use this optimization to accelerate a web app that includes numerous responses that aren't cacheable. Examples are search results, checkout transactions, or real-time data. You can continue to use core Azure CDN caching capabilities for static data.

       Box 1: Azure Backup -
       <br/>
       The VM is critical and has not been backed up in the past. The VM must enable a quick restore from a 7-day snapshot to include in-place restore of disks in case of failure.
       <br/>
       In-Place restore of disks in IaaS VMs is a feature of Azure Backup.
       <br/>
       Performance: Accelerated Networking
       <br/>
       Scenario: The VM shows high network latency, jitter, and high CPU utilization.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Box 2: Accelerated networking -
       <br/>
       The VM shows high network latency, jitter, and high CPU utilization.
       <br/>
       Accelerated networking enables single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to a VM, greatly improving its networking performance. This high-performance path bypasses the host from the datapath, reducing latency, jitter, and CPU utilization, for use with the most demanding network workloads on supported VM types.

Clicking these buttons displays information such as business requirements, existing environment, and problem statements. When you are ready to answer a question, click the Question button to return to the question.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Background -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Overview -
      <br/>
      You are a developer for Contoso, Ltd. The company has a social networking website that is developed as a Single Page Application (SPA). The main web application for the social networking website loads user uploaded content from blob storage.
      <br/>
      You are developing a solution to monitor uploaded data for inappropriate content. The following process occurs when users upload content by using the SPA:
      <br/>
      * Messages are sent to ContentUploadService.
      <br/>
      * Content is processed by ContentAnalysisService.
      <br/>
      * After processing is complete, the content is posted to the social network or a rejection message is posted in its place.
      <br/>
      The ContentAnalysisService is deployed with Azure Container Instances from a private Azure Container Registry named contosoimages.
      <br/>
      The solution will use eight CPU cores.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Azure Active Directory -
      <br/>
      Contoso, Ltd. uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for both internal and guest accounts.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Requirements -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      ContentAnalysisService -
      <br/>
      The company's data science group built ContentAnalysisService which accepts user generated content as a string and returns a probable value for inappropriate content. Any values over a specific threshold must be reviewed by an employee of Contoso, Ltd.
      <br/>
      You must create an Azure Function named CheckUserContent to perform the content checks.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Costs -
      <br/>
      You must minimize costs for all Azure services.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Manual review -
      <br/>
      To review content, the user must authenticate to the website portion of the ContentAnalysisService using their Azure AD credentials. The website is built using
      <br/>
      React and all pages and API endpoints require authentication. In order to review content a user must be part of a ContentReviewer role. All completed reviews must include the reviewer's email address for auditing purposes.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      High availability -
      <br/>
      All services must run in multiple regions. The failure of any service in a region must not impact overall application availability.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Monitoring -
      <br/>
      An alert must be raised if the ContentUploadService uses more than 80 percent of available CPU cores.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Security -
      <br/>
      You have the following security requirements:
      <br/>
      Any web service accessible over the Internet must be protected from cross site scripting attacks.
      <br/>
      All websites and services must use SSL from a valid root certificate authority.
      <br/>
      Azure Storage access keys must only be stored in memory and must be available only to the service.
      <br/>
      All Internal services must only be accessible from internal Virtual Networks (VNets).
      <br/>
      All parts of the system must support inbound and outbound traffic restrictions.
      <br/>
      All service calls must be authenticated by using Azure AD.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      User agreements -
      <br/>
      When a user submits content, they must agree to a user agreement. The agreement allows employees of Contoso, Ltd. to review content, store cookies on user devices, and track user's IP addresses.
      <br/>
      Information regarding agreements is used by multiple divisions within Contoso, Ltd.
      <br/>
      User responses must not be lost and must be available to all parties regardless of individual service uptime. The volume of agreements is expected to be in the millions per hour.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Validation testing -
      <br/>
      When a new version of the ContentAnalysisService is available the previous seven days of content must be processed with the new version to verify that the new version does not significantly deviate from the old version.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Issues -
      <br/>
      Users of the ContentUploadService report that they occasionally see HTTP 502 responses on specific pages.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Code -
      <br/>
      <br/>

Each question is independent of the other questions in this case study.
      <br/>
      At the end of this case study, a review screen will appear. This screen allows you to review your answers and to make changes before you move to the next section of the exam. After you begin a new section, you cannot return to this section.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      To start the case study -
      <br/>
      To display the first question in this case study, click the Next button. Use the buttons in the left pane to explore the content of the case study before you answer the questions.

      <br/>
      <br/>
      Background -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Overview -
      <br/>
      You are a developer for Contoso, Ltd. The company has a social networking website that is developed as a Single Page Application (SPA). The main web application for the social networking website loads user uploaded content from blob storage.
      <br/>
      You are developing a solution to monitor uploaded data for inappropriate content. The following process occurs when users upload content by using the SPA:
      <br/>
      * Messages are sent to ContentUploadService.
      <br/>
      * Content is processed by ContentAnalysisService.
      <br/>
      * After processing is complete, the content is posted to the social network or a rejection message is posted in its place.
      <br/>
      The ContentAnalysisService is deployed with Azure Container Instances from a private Azure Container Registry named contosoimages.
      <br/>
      The solution will use eight CPU cores.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Azure Active Directory -
      <br/>
      Contoso, Ltd. uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for both internal and guest accounts.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Requirements -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      ContentAnalysisService -
      <br/>
      The company's data science group built ContentAnalysisService which accepts user generated content as a string and returns a probable value for inappropriate content. Any values over a specific threshold must be reviewed by an employee of Contoso, Ltd.
      <br/>
      You must create an Azure Function named CheckUserContent to perform the content checks.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Costs -
      <br/>
      You must minimize costs for all Azure services.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Manual review -
      <br/>
      To review content, the user must authenticate to the website portion of the ContentAnalysisService using their Azure AD credentials. The website is built using
      <br/>
      React and all pages and API endpoints require authentication. In order to review content a user must be part of a ContentReviewer role. All completed reviews must include the reviewer's email address for auditing purposes.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      High availability -
      <br/>
      All services must run in multiple regions. The failure of any service in a region must not impact overall application availability.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Monitoring -
      <br/>
      An alert must be raised if the ContentUploadService uses more than 80 percent of available CPU cores.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Security -
      <br/>
      You have the following security requirements:
      <br/>
      Any web service accessible over the Internet must be protected from cross site scripting attacks.
      <br/>
      All websites and services must use SSL from a valid root certificate authority.
      <br/>
      Azure Storage access keys must only be stored in memory and must be available only to the service.
      <br/>
      All Internal services must only be accessible from internal Virtual Networks (VNets).
      <br/>
      All parts of the system must support inbound and outbound traffic restrictions.
      <br/>
      All service calls must be authenticated by using Azure AD.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      User agreements -
      <br/>
      When a user submits content, they must agree to a user agreement. The agreement allows employees of Contoso, Ltd. to review content, store cookies on user devices, and track user's IP addresses.
      <br/>
      Information regarding agreements is used by multiple divisions within Contoso, Ltd.
      <br/>
      User responses must not be lost and must be available to all parties regardless of individual service uptime. The volume of agreements is expected to be in the millions per hour.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Validation testing -
      <br/>
      When a new version of the ContentAnalysisService is available the previous seven days of content must be processed with the new version to verify that the new version does not significantly deviate from the old version.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Issues -
      <br/>
      Users of the ContentUploadService report that they occasionally see HTTP 502 responses on specific pages.
      <br/>
      <br/>

       <br/>
       Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) on Azure Application Gateway provides centralized protection of your web applications from common exploits and vulnerabilities. Web applications are increasingly targeted by malicious attacks that exploit commonly known vulnerabilities. SQL injection and cross-site scripting are among the most common attacks.
       <br/>
       Application Gateway supports autoscaling, SSL offloading, and end-to-end SSL, a web application firewall (WAF), cookie-based session affinity, URL path-based routing, multisite hosting, redirection, rewrite HTTP headers and other features.
       <br/>
       Note: Both Nginx and Azure Application Gateway act as a reverse proxy with Layer 7 load-balancing features plus a WAF to ensure strong protection against common web vulnerabilities and exploits.
       <br/>
       You can modify Nginx web server configuration/SSL for X-XSS protection. This helps to prevent cross-site scripting exploits by forcing the injection of HTTP headers with X-XSS protection.

      <br/>
      <br/>
      Background -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Overview -
      <br/>
      You are a developer for Contoso, Ltd. The company has a social networking website that is developed as a Single Page Application (SPA). The main web application for the social networking website loads user uploaded content from blob storage.
      <br/>
      You are developing a solution to monitor uploaded data for inappropriate content. The following process occurs when users upload content by using the SPA:
      <br/>
      * Messages are sent to ContentUploadService.
      <br/>
      * Content is processed by ContentAnalysisService.
      <br/>
      * After processing is complete, the content is posted to the social network or a rejection message is posted in its place.
      <br/>
      The ContentAnalysisService is deployed with Azure Container Instances from a private Azure Container Registry named contosoimages.
      <br/>
      The solution will use eight CPU cores.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Azure Active Directory -
      <br/>
      Contoso, Ltd. uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for both internal and guest accounts.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Requirements -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      ContentAnalysisService -
      <br/>
      The company's data science group built ContentAnalysisService which accepts user generated content as a string and returns a probable value for inappropriate content. Any values over a specific threshold must be reviewed by an employee of Contoso, Ltd.
      <br/>
      You must create an Azure Function named CheckUserContent to perform the content checks.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Costs -
      <br/>
      You must minimize costs for all Azure services.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Manual review -
      <br/>
      To review content, the user must authenticate to the website portion of the ContentAnalysisService using their Azure AD credentials. The website is built using
      <br/>
      React and all pages and API endpoints require authentication. In order to review content a user must be part of a ContentReviewer role. All completed reviews must include the reviewer's email address for auditing purposes.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      High availability -
      <br/>
      All services must run in multiple regions. The failure of any service in a region must not impact overall application availability.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Monitoring -
      <br/>
      An alert must be raised if the ContentUploadService uses more than 80 percent of available CPU cores.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Security -
      <br/>
      You have the following security requirements:
      <br/>
      Any web service accessible over the Internet must be protected from cross site scripting attacks.
      <br/>
      All websites and services must use SSL from a valid root certificate authority.
      <br/>
      Azure Storage access keys must only be stored in memory and must be available only to the service.
      <br/>
      All Internal services must only be accessible from internal Virtual Networks (VNets).
      <br/>
      All parts of the system must support inbound and outbound traffic restrictions.
      <br/>
      All service calls must be authenticated by using Azure AD.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      User agreements -
      <br/>
      When a user submits content, they must agree to a user agreement. The agreement allows employees of Contoso, Ltd. to review content, store cookies on user devices, and track user's IP addresses.
      <br/>
      Information regarding agreements is used by multiple divisions within Contoso, Ltd.
      <br/>
      User responses must not be lost and must be available to all parties regardless of individual service uptime. The volume of agreements is expected to be in the millions per hour.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Validation testing -
      <br/>
      When a new version of the ContentAnalysisService is available the previous seven days of content must be processed with the new version to verify that the new version does not significantly deviate from the old version.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Issues -
      <br/>
      Users of the ContentUploadService report that they occasionally see HTTP 502 responses on specific pages.
      <br/>
      <br/>

       Question
      </span>
      DRAG DROP -
      <br/>
      You need to add YAML markup at line CS17 to ensure that the ContentUploadService can access Azure Storage access keys.
      <br/>
      How should you complete the YAML markup? To answer, drag the appropriate YAML segments to the correct locations. Each YAML segment may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.
      <br/>
      NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

      <br/>
      Current environment -
      <br/>
      Windows Server 2016 virtual machine
      <br/>
      This virtual machine (VM) runs BizTalk Server 2016. The VM runs the following workflows:
      <br/>
      Ocean Transport `" This workflow gathers and validates container information including container contents and arrival notices at various shipping ports.
      <br/>
      Inland Transport `" This workflow gathers and validates trucking information including fuel usage, number of stops, and routes.
      <br/>
      The VM supports the following REST API calls:
      <br/>
      Container API `" This API provides container information including weight, contents, and other attributes.
      <br/>
      Location API `" This API provides location information regarding shipping ports of call and trucking stops.
      <br/>
      Shipping REST API `" This API provides shipping information for use and display on the shipping website.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Shipping Data -
      <br/>
      The application uses MongoDB JSON document storage database for all container and transport information.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Shipping Web Site -
      <br/>
      The site displays shipping container tracking information and container contents. The site is located at http://shipping.wideworldimporters.com/
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Proposed solution -
      <br/>
      The on-premises shipping application must be moved to Azure. The VM has been migrated to a new Standard_D16s_v3 Azure VM by using Azure Site Recovery and must remain running in Azure to complete the BizTalk component migrations. You create a Standard_D16s_v3 Azure VM to host BizTalk Server. The Azure architecture diagram for the proposed solution is shown below:

      <br/>
      Current environment -
      <br/>
      Windows Server 2016 virtual machine
      <br/>
      This virtual machine (VM) runs BizTalk Server 2016. The VM runs the following workflows:
      <br/>
      Ocean Transport `" This workflow gathers and validates container information including container contents and arrival notices at various shipping ports.
      <br/>
      Inland Transport `" This workflow gathers and validates trucking information including fuel usage, number of stops, and routes.
      <br/>
      The VM supports the following REST API calls:
      <br/>
      Container API `" This API provides container information including weight, contents, and other attributes.
      <br/>
      Location API `" This API provides location information regarding shipping ports of call and trucking stops.
      <br/>
      Shipping REST API `" This API provides shipping information for use and display on the shipping website.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Shipping Data -
      <br/>
      The application uses MongoDB JSON document storage database for all container and transport information.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Shipping Web Site -
      <br/>
      The site displays shipping container tracking information and container contents. The site is located at http://shipping.wideworldimporters.com/
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Proposed solution -
      <br/>
      The on-premises shipping application must be moved to Azure. The VM has been migrated to a new Standard_D16s_v3 Azure VM by using Azure Site Recovery and must remain running in Azure to complete the BizTalk component migrations. You create a Standard_D16s_v3 Azure VM to host BizTalk Server. The Azure architecture diagram for the proposed solution is shown below:

       Scenario: The Shipping Logic App requires secure resources to the corporate VNet and use dedicated storage resources with a fixed costing model.
       <br/>
       You can access to Azure Virtual Network resources from Azure Logic Apps by using integration service environments (ISEs).
       <br/>
       Sometimes, your logic apps and integration accounts need access to secured resources, such as virtual machines (VMs) and other systems or services, that are inside an Azure virtual network. To set up this access, you can create an integration service environment (ISE) where you can run your logic apps and create your integration accounts.

      Background -
      <br/>
      City Power &amp; Light company provides electrical infrastructure monitoring solutions for homes and businesses. The company is migrating solutions to Azure.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Current environment -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Architecture overview -
      <br/>
      The company has a public website located at http://www.cpandl.com/. The site is a single-page web application that runs in Azure App Service on Linux. The website uses files stored in Azure Storage and cached in Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve static content.
      <br/>
      API Management and Azure Function App functions are used to process and store data in Azure Database for PostgreSQL. API Management is used to broker communications to the Azure Function app functions for Logic app integration. Logic apps are used to orchestrate the data processing while Service Bus and
      <br/>
      Event Grid handle messaging and events.
      <br/>
      The solution uses Application Insights, Azure Monitor, and Azure Key Vault.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Architecture diagram -
      <br/>
      The company has several applications and services that support their business. The company plans to implement serverless computing where possible. The overall architecture is shown below.
      <br/>
      <img class="in-exam-image" src="https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03861/0021300001.png"/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      User authentication -
      <br/>
      The following steps detail the user authentication process:
      <br/>
      1. The user selects Sign in in the website.
      <br/>
      2. The browser redirects the user to the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) sign in page.
      <br/>
      3. The user signs in.
      <br/>
      4. Azure AD redirects the user's session back to the web application. The URL includes an access token.
      <br/>
      5. The web application calls an API and includes the access token in the authentication header. The application ID is sent as the audience (`˜aud') claim in the access token.
      <br/>
      6. The back-end API validates the access token.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Requirements -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Corporate website -

      <br/>
      Id: 80df3e46ffcd4f1cb187f79905e9a1e8
      <br/>
      The connection information is updated frequently. The application must always use the latest information to connect to the database.
      <br/>
      Azure Service Bus and Azure Event Grid
      <br/>
      Azure Event Grid must use Azure Service Bus for queue-based load leveling.
      <br/>
      Events in Azure Event Grid must be routed directly to Service Bus queues for use in buffering.
      <br/>
      Events from Azure Service Bus and other Azure services must continue to be routed to Azure Event Grid for processing.
      <br/>
      <br/>

      Background -
      <br/>
      City Power &amp; Light company provides electrical infrastructure monitoring solutions for homes and businesses. The company is migrating solutions to Azure.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Current environment -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Architecture overview -
      <br/>
      The company has a public website located at http://www.cpandl.com/. The site is a single-page web application that runs in Azure App Service on Linux. The website uses files stored in Azure Storage and cached in Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve static content.
      <br/>
      API Management and Azure Function App functions are used to process and store data in Azure Database for PostgreSQL. API Management is used to broker communications to the Azure Function app functions for Logic app integration. Logic apps are used to orchestrate the data processing while Service Bus and
      <br/>
      Event Grid handle messaging and events.
      <br/>
      The solution uses Application Insights, Azure Monitor, and Azure Key Vault.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Architecture diagram -
      <br/>
      The company has several applications and services that support their business. The company plans to implement serverless computing where possible. The overall architecture is shown below.
      <br/>
      <img class="in-exam-image" src="https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03861/0021300001.png"/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      User authentication -
      <br/>
      The following steps detail the user authentication process:
      <br/>
      1. The user selects Sign in in the website.
      <br/>
      2. The browser redirects the user to the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) sign in page.
      <br/>
      3. The user signs in.
      <br/>
      4. Azure AD redirects the user's session back to the web application. The URL includes an access token.
      <br/>
      5. The web application calls an API and includes the access token in the authentication header. The application ID is sent as the audience (`˜aud') claim in the access token.
      <br/>
      6. The back-end API validates the access token.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Requirements -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Corporate website -
      <br/>
      Communications and content must be secured by using SSL.
      <br/>
      Communications must use HTTPS.
      <br/>
      Data must be replicated to a secondary region and three availability zones.
      <br/>
      Data storage costs must be minimized.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Azure Database for PostgreSQL -
      <br/>
      The database connection string is stored in Azure Key Vault with the following attributes:
      <br/>
      Azure Key Vault name: cpandlkeyvault
      <br/>
      Secret name: PostgreSQLConn
      <br/>
      Id: 80df3e46ffcd4f1cb187f79905e9a1e8
      <br/>
      The connection information is updated frequently. The application must always use the latest information to connect to the database.
      <br/>
      Azure Service Bus and Azure Event Grid
      <br/>
      Azure Event Grid must use Azure Service Bus for queue-based load leveling.
      <br/>
      Events in Azure Event Grid must be routed directly to Service Bus queues for use in buffering.
      <br/>
      Events from Azure Service Bus and other Azure services must continue to be routed to Azure Event Grid for processing.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Security -
      <br/>
      All SSL certificates and credentials must be stored in Azure Key Vault.
      <br/>
      File access must restrict access by IP, protocol, and Azure AD rights.
      <br/>
      All user accounts and processes must receive only those privileges which are essential to perform their intended function.
      <br/>
      <br/>

       Box 1: Validate JWT -
       <br/>
       The validate-jwt policy enforces existence and validity of a JWT extracted from either a specified HTTP Header or a specified query parameter.
       <br/>
       Scenario: User authentication (see step 5 below)
       <br/>
       The following steps detail the user authentication process:
       <br/>
       1. The user selects Sign in in the website.
       <br/>
       2. The browser redirects the user to the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) sign in page.
       <br/>
       3. The user signs in.
       <br/>
       4. Azure AD redirects the userג€™s session back to the web application. The URL includes an access token.
       <br/>
       5. The web application calls an API and includes the access token in the authentication header. The application ID is sent as the audience (ג€˜audג€™) claim in the access token.
       <br/>
       6. The back-end API validates the access token.
       <br/>
       Incorrect Answers:
       <br/>
       ✑ Limit call rate by key - Prevents API usage spikes by limiting call rate, on a per key basis.
       <br/>
       ✑ Restrict caller IPs - Filters (allows/denies) calls from specific IP addresses and/or address ranges.
       <br/>
       ✑ Check HTTP header - Enforces existence and/or value of a HTTP Header.
       <br/>

       A: Claims in access tokens -
       <br/>
       JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) are split into three pieces:
       <br/>
       ✑ Header - Provides information about how to validate the token including information about the type of token and how it was signed.
       <br/>
       ✑ Payload - Contains all of the important data about the user or app that is attempting to call your service.
       <br/>
       ✑ Signature - Is the raw material used to validate the token.
       <br/>
       E: Your client can get an access token from either the v1.0 endpoint or the v2.0 endpoint using a variety of protocols.
       <br/>

       Scenario: You test the Logic app in a development environment. The following error message displays:
       <br/>
       '400 Bad Request'
       <br/>
       Troubleshooting of the error shows an HttpTrigger action to call the RequestUserApproval function.
       <br/>
       Note: If the inbound call's request body doesn't match your schema, the trigger returns an HTTP 400 Bad Request error.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Box 1: function -
       <br/>
       If you have an Azure function where you want to use the system-assigned identity, first enable authentication for Azure functions.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Box 2: system-assigned -
       <br/>
       Your logic app or individual connections can use either the system-assigned identity or a single user-assigned identity, which you can share across a group of logic apps, but not both.

      <br/>
      Background -
      <br/>
      City Power &amp; Light company provides electrical infrastructure monitoring solutions for homes and businesses. The company is migrating solutions to Azure.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Current environment -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Architecture overview -
      <br/>
      The company has a public website located at http://www.cpandl.com/. The site is a single-page web application that runs in Azure App Service on Linux. The website uses files stored in Azure Storage and cached in Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve static content.
      <br/>
      API Management and Azure Function App functions are used to process and store data in Azure Database for PostgreSQL. API Management is used to broker communications to the Azure Function app functions for Logic app integration. Logic apps are used to orchestrate the data processing while Service Bus and
      <br/>
      Event Grid handle messaging and events.
      <br/>
      The solution uses Application Insights, Azure Monitor, and Azure Key Vault.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Architecture diagram -
      <br/>
      The company has several applications and services that support their business. The company plans to implement serverless computing where possible. The overall architecture is shown below.
      <br/>
      <img class="in-exam-image" src="https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03861/0021300001.png"/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      User authentication -
      <br/>
      The following steps detail the user authentication process:
      <br/>
      1. The user selects Sign in in the website.
      <br/>
      2. The browser redirects the user to the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) sign in page.
      <br/>
      3. The user signs in.
      <br/>
      4. Azure AD redirects the user's session back to the web application. The URL includes an access token.
      <br/>
      5. The web application calls an API and includes the access token in the authentication header. The application ID is sent as the audience (`˜aud') claim in the access token.
      <br/>
      6. The back-end API validates the access token.
      <br/>
      <br/>

      <br/>
      Background -
      <br/>
      You are a developer for Litware Inc., a SaaS company that provides a solution for managing employee expenses. The solution consists of an ASP.NET Core Web
      <br/>
      API project that is deployed as an Azure Web App.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Overall architecture -
      <br/>
      Employees upload receipts for the system to process. When processing is complete, the employee receives a summary report email that details the processing results. Employees then use a web application to manage their receipts and perform any additional tasks needed for reimbursement.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Receipt processing -
      <br/>
      Employees may upload receipts in two ways:
      <br/>
      Uploading using an Azure Files mounted folder
      <br/>
      Uploading using the web application
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Data Storage -
      <br/>
      Receipt and employee information is stored in an Azure SQL database.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Documentation -
      <br/>
      Employees are provided with a getting started document when they first use the solution. The documentation includes details on supported operating systems for
      <br/>
      Azure File upload, and instructions on how to configure the mounted folder.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Solution details -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Users table -
      <br/>
      <img class="in-exam-image" src="https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03861/0022800001.png"/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Web Application -
      <br/>
      You enable MSI for the Web App and configure the Web App to use the security principal name WebAppIdentity.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Processing -
      <br/>
      Processing is performed by an Azure Function that uses version 2 of the Azure Function runtime. Once processing is completed, results are stored in Azure Blob
      <br/>
      Storage and an Azure SQL database. Then, an email summary is sent to the user with a link to the processing report. The link to the report must remain valid if the email is forwarded to another user.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Logging -
      <br/>
      Azure Application Insights is used for telemetry and logging in both the processor and the web application. The processor also has TraceWriter logging enabled.
      <br/>
      Application Insights must always contain all log messages.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Requirements -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Receipt processing -
      <br/>
      Concurrent processing of a receipt must be prevented.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Disaster recovery -
      <br/>
      Regional outage must not impact application availability. All DR operations must not be dependent on application running and must ensure that data in the DR region is up to date.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Security -
      <br/>
      User's SecurityPin must be stored in such a way that access to the database does not allow the viewing of SecurityPins. The web application is the only system that should have access to SecurityPins.
      <br/>
      All certificates and secrets used to secure data must be stored in Azure Key Vault.
      <br/>
      You must adhere to the principle of least privilege and provide privileges which are essential to perform the intended function.
      <br/>
      All access to Azure Storage and Azure SQL database must use the application's Managed Service Identity (MSI).
      <br/>
      Receipt data must always be encrypted at rest.
      <br/>
      All data must be protected in transit.
      <br/>
      User's expense account number must be visible only to logged in users. All other views of the expense account number should include only the last segment, with the remaining parts obscured.
      <br/>
      In the case of a security breach, access to all summary reports must be revoked without impacting other parts of the system.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Issues -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Upload format issue -
      <br/>
      Employees occasionally report an issue with uploading a receipt using the web application. They report that when they upload a receipt using the Azure File
      <br/>
      Share, the receipt does not appear in their profile. When this occurs, they delete the file in the file share and use the web application, which returns a 500 Internal
      <br/>
      Server error page.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Capacity issue -
      <br/>
      During busy periods, employees report long delays between the time they upload the receipt and when it appears in the web application.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Log capacity issue -
      <br/>
      Developers report that the number of log messages in the trace output for the processor is too high, resulting in lost log messages.

      Case study -
      <br/>
      This is a case study. Case studies are not timed separately. You can use as much exam time as you would like to complete each case. However, there may be additional case studies and sections on this exam. You must manage your time to ensure that you are able to complete all questions included on this exam in the time provided.
      <br/>
      To answer the questions included in a case study, you will need to reference information that is provided in the case study. Case studies might contain exhibits and other resources that provide more information about the scenario that is described in the case study. Each question is independent of the other questions in this case study.
      <br/>
      At the end of this case study, a review screen will appear. This screen allows you to review your answers and to make changes before you move to the next section of the exam. After you begin a new section, you cannot return to this section.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      To start the case study -
      <br/>
      To display the first question in this case study, click the Next button. Use the buttons in the left pane to explore the content of the case study before you answer the questions. Clicking these buttons displays information such as business requirements, existing environment, and problem statements. When you are ready to answer a question, click the Question button to return to the question.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Background -
      <br/>
      You are a developer for Litware Inc., a SaaS company that provides a solution for managing employee expenses. The solution consists of an ASP.NET Core Web
      <br/>
      API project that is deployed as an Azure Web App.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Overall architecture -
      <br/>
      Employees upload receipts for the system to process. When processing is complete, the employee receives a summary report email that details the processing results. Employees then use a web application to manage their receipts and perform any additional tasks needed for reimbursement.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Receipt processing -
      <br/>
      Employees may upload receipts in two ways:
      <br/>
      Uploading using an Azure Files mounted folder
      <br/>
      Uploading using the web application
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Data Storage -
      <br/>
      Receipt and employee information is stored in an Azure SQL database.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Documentation -
      <br/>
      Employees are provided with a getting started document when they first use the solution. The documentation includes details on supported operating systems for
      <br/>
      Azure File upload, and instructions on how to configure the mounted folder.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Solution details -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Users table -
      <br/>
      <img class="in-exam-image" src="https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03861/0022800001.png"/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Web Application -
      <br/>
      You enable MSI for the Web App and configure the Web App to use the security principal name WebAppIdentity.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Processing -
      <br/>
      Processing is performed by an Azure Function that uses version 2 of the Azure Function runtime. Once processing is completed, results are stored in Azure Blob
      <br/>
      Storage and an Azure SQL database. Then, an email summary is sent to the user with a link to the processing report. The link to the report must remain valid if the email is forwarded to another user.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Logging -
      <br/>
      Azure Application Insights is used for telemetry and logging in both the processor and the web application. The processor also has TraceWriter logging enabled.
      <br/>
      Application Insights must always contain all log messages.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Requirements -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Receipt processing -
      <br/>
      Concurrent processing of a receipt must be prevented.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Disaster recovery -
      <br/>
      Regional outage must not impact application availability. All DR operations must not be dependent on application running and must ensure that data in the DR region is up to date.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Security -
      <br/>
      User's SecurityPin must be stored in such a way that access to the database does not allow the viewing of SecurityPins. The web application is the only system that should have access to SecurityPins.
      <br/>
      All certificates and secrets used to secure data must be stored in Azure Key Vault.
      <br/>
      You must adhere to the principle of least privilege and provide privileges which are essential to perform the intended function.
      <br/>
      All access to Azure Storage and Azure SQL database must use the application's Managed Service Identity (MSI).
      <br/>
      Receipt data must always be encrypted at rest.
      <br/>
      All data must be protected in transit.
      <br/>
      User's expense account number must be visible only to logged in users. All other views of the expense account number should include only the last segment, with the remaining parts obscured.
      <br/>
      In the case of a security breach, access to all summary reports must be revoked without impacting other parts of the system.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Issues -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Upload format issue -
      <br/>
      Employees occasionally report an issue with uploading a receipt using the web application. They report that when they upload a receipt using the Azure File
      <br/>
      Share, the receipt does not appear in their profile. When this occurs, they delete the file in the file share and use the web application, which returns a 500 Internal
      <br/>
      Server error page.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Capacity issue -
      <br/>
      During busy periods, employees report long delays between the time they upload the receipt and when it appears in the web application.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Log capacity issue -
      <br/>
      Developers report that the number of log messages in the trace output for the processor is too high, resulting in lost log messages.

      To start the case study -
      <br/>
      To display the first question in this case study, click the Next button. Use the buttons in the left pane to explore the content of the case study before you answer the questions. Clicking these buttons displays information such as business requirements, existing environment, and problem statements. When you are ready to answer a question, click the Question button to return to the question.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Background -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Overview -
      <br/>
      You are a developer for Contoso, Ltd. The company has a social networking website that is developed as a Single Page Application (SPA). The main web application for the social networking website loads user uploaded content from blob storage.
      <br/>
      You are developing a solution to monitor uploaded data for inappropriate content. The following process occurs when users upload content by using the SPA:
      <br/>
      * Messages are sent to ContentUploadService.
      <br/>
      * Content is processed by ContentAnalysisService.
      <br/>
      * After processing is complete, the content is posted to the social network or a rejection message is posted in its place.
      <br/>
      The ContentAnalysisService is deployed with Azure Container Instances from a private Azure Container Registry named contosoimages.
      <br/>
      The solution will use eight CPU cores.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Azure Active Directory -
      <br/>
      Contoso, Ltd. uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for both internal and guest accounts.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Requirements -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      ContentAnalysisService -
      <br/>
      The company's data science group built ContentAnalysisService which accepts user generated content as a string and returns a probable value for inappropriate content. Any values over a specific threshold must be reviewed by an employee of Contoso, Ltd.
      <br/>
      You must create an Azure Function named CheckUserContent to perform the content checks.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Costs -
      <br/>
      You must minimize costs for all Azure services.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Manual review -
      <br/>
      To review content, the user must authenticate to the website portion of the ContentAnalysisService using their Azure AD credentials. The website is built using
      <br/>
      React and all pages and API endpoints require authentication. In order to review content a user must be part of a ContentReviewer role. All completed reviews must include the reviewer's email address for auditing purposes.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      High availability -
      <br/>
      All services must run in multiple regions. The failure of any service in a region must not impact overall application availability.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Monitoring -
      <br/>
      An alert must be raised if the ContentUploadService uses more than 80 percent of available CPU cores.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Security -
      <br/>
      You have the following security requirements:
      <br/>
      Any web service accessible over the Internet must be protected from cross site scripting attacks.
      <br/>
      All websites and services must use SSL from a valid root certificate authority.
      <br/>
      Azure Storage access keys must only be stored in memory and must be available only to the service.
      <br/>
      All Internal services must only be accessible from internal Virtual Networks (VNets).
      <br/>
      All parts of the system must support inbound and outbound traffic restrictions.
      <br/>
      All service calls must be authenticated by using Azure AD.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      User agreements -
      <br/>
      When a user submits content, they must agree to a user agreement. The agreement allows employees of Contoso, Ltd. to review content, store cookies on user devices, and track user's IP addresses.
      <br/>
      Information regarding agreements is used by multiple divisions within Contoso, Ltd.
      <br/>
      User responses must not be lost and must be available to all parties regardless of individual service uptime. The volume of agreements is expected to be in the millions per hour.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Validation testing -
      <br/>
      When a new version of the ContentAnalysisService is available the previous seven days of content must be processed with the new version to verify that the new version does not significantly deviate from the old version.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Issues -
      <br/>
      Users of the ContentUploadService report that they occasionally see HTTP 502 responses on specific pages.
      <br/>
      <br/>

      <br/>
      This is a case study. Case studies are not timed separately. You can use as much exam time as you would like to complete each case. However, there may be additional case studies and sections on this exam. You must manage your time to ensure that you are able to complete all questions included on this exam in the time provided.
      <br/>
      To answer the questions included in a case study, you will need to reference information that is provided in the case study. Case studies might contain exhibits and other resources that provide more information about the scenario that is described in the case study. Each question is independent of the other questions in this case study.
      <br/>
      At the end of this case study, a review screen will appear. This screen allows you to review your answers and to make changes before you move to the next section of the exam. After you begin a new section, you cannot return to this section.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      To start the case study -
      <br/>
      To display the first question in this case study, click the Next button. Use the buttons in the left pane to explore the content of the case study before you answer the questions. Clicking these buttons displays information such as business requirements, existing environment, and problem statements. When you are ready to answer a question, click the Question button to return to the question.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Background -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Overview -
      <br/>
      You are a developer for Contoso, Ltd. The company has a social networking website that is developed as a Single Page Application (SPA). The main web application for the social networking website loads user uploaded content from blob storage.
      <br/>
      You are developing a solution to monitor uploaded data for inappropriate content. The following process occurs when users upload content by using the SPA:
      <br/>
      * Messages are sent to ContentUploadService.
      <br/>
      * Content is processed by ContentAnalysisService.
      <br/>
      * After processing is complete, the content is posted to the social network or a rejection message is posted in its place.
      <br/>
      The ContentAnalysisService is deployed with Azure Container Instances from a private Azure Container Registry named contosoimages.
      <br/>
      The solution will use eight CPU cores.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Azure Active Directory -
      <br/>
      Contoso, Ltd. uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for both internal and guest accounts.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Requirements -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      ContentAnalysisService -
      <br/>
      The company's data science group built ContentAnalysisService which accepts user generated content as a string and returns a probable value for inappropriate content. Any values over a specific threshold must be reviewed by an employee of Contoso, Ltd.
      <br/>
      You must create an Azure Function named CheckUserContent to perform the content checks.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Costs -
      <br/>
      You must minimize costs for all Azure services.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Manual review -
      <br/>
      To review content, the user must authenticate to the website portion of the ContentAnalysisService using their Azure AD credentials. The website is built using
      <br/>
      React and all pages and API endpoints require authentication. In order to review content a user must be part of a ContentReviewer role. All completed reviews must include the reviewer's email address for auditing purposes.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      High availability -
      <br/>
      All services must run in multiple regions. The failure of any service in a region must not impact overall application availability.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Monitoring -
      <br/>
      An alert must be raised if the ContentUploadService uses more than 80 percent of available CPU cores.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Security -
      <br/>
      You have the following security requirements:
      <br/>
      Any web service accessible over the Internet must be protected from cross site scripting attacks.
      <br/>
      All websites and services must use SSL from a valid root certificate authority.
      <br/>
      Azure Storage access keys must only be stored in memory and must be available only to the service.
      <br/>
      All Internal services must only be accessible from internal Virtual Networks (VNets).
      <br/>
      All parts of the system must support inbound and outbound traffic restrictions.
      <br/>
      All service calls must be authenticated by using Azure AD.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      User agreements -
      <br/>
      When a user submits content, they must agree to a user agreement. The agreement allows employees of Contoso, Ltd. to review content, store cookies on user devices, and track user's IP addresses.
      <br/>
      Information regarding agreements is used by multiple divisions within Contoso, Ltd.
      <br/>
      User responses must not be lost and must be available to all parties regardless of individual service uptime. The volume of agreements is expected to be in the millions per hour.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Validation testing -
      <br/>
      When a new version of the ContentAnalysisService is available the previous seven days of content must be processed with the new version to verify that the new version does not significantly deviate from the old version.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Issues -
      <br/>
      Users of the ContentUploadService report that they occasionally see HTTP 502 responses on specific pages.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Code -
      <br/>
      <br/>

       Scenario: Users of the ContentUploadService report that they occasionally see HTTP 502 responses on specific pages.
       <br/>
       "502 bad gateway" and "503 service unavailable" are common errors in your app hosted in Azure App Service.
       <br/>
       Microsoft Azure publicizes each time there is a service interruption or performance degradation.

      Background -
      <br/>
      City Power &amp; Light company provides electrical infrastructure monitoring solutions for homes and businesses. The company is migrating solutions to Azure.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Current environment -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Architecture overview -
      <br/>
      The company has a public website located at http://www.cpandl.com/. The site is a single-page web application that runs in Azure App Service on Linux. The website uses files stored in Azure Storage and cached in Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve static content.
      <br/>
      API Management and Azure Function App functions are used to process and store data in Azure Database for PostgreSQL. API Management is used to broker communications to the Azure Function app functions for Logic app integration. Logic apps are used to orchestrate the data processing while Service Bus and
      <br/>
      Event Grid handle messaging and events.
      <br/>
      The solution uses Application Insights, Azure Monitor, and Azure Key Vault.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Architecture diagram -
      <br/>
      The company has several applications and services that support their business. The company plans to implement serverless computing where possible. The overall architecture is shown below.
      <br/>
      <img class="in-exam-image" src="https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03861/0029900001.png"/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      User authentication -
      <br/>
      The following steps detail the user authentication process:
      <br/>
      1. The user selects Sign in in the website.
      <br/>
      2. The browser redirects the user to the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) sign in page.
      <br/>
      3. The user signs in.
      <br/>
      4. Azure AD redirects the user's session back to the web application. The URL includes an access token.
      <br/>
      5. The web application calls an API and includes the access token in the authentication header. The application ID is sent as the audience (`˜aud') claim in the access token.
      <br/>
      6. The back-end API validates the access token.
      <br/>
      <br/>

      <br/>
      Id: 80df3e46ffcd4f1cb187f79905e9a1e8
      <br/>
      The connection information is updated frequently. The application must always use the latest information to connect to the database.
      <br/>
      Azure Service Bus and Azure Event Grid
      <br/>
      Azure Event Grid must use Azure Service Bus for queue-based load leveling.
      <br/>
      Events in Azure Event Grid must be routed directly to Service Bus queues for use in buffering.
      <br/>
      Events from Azure Service Bus and other Azure services must continue to be routed to Azure Event Grid for processing.
      <br/>
      <br/>

      <br/>
      <br/>
      Function app -
      <br/>
      You perform local testing for the RequestUserApproval function. The following error message displays:
      <br/>
      'Timeout value of 00:10:00 exceeded by function: RequestUserApproval'
      <br/>
      The same error message displays when you test the function in an Azure development environment when you run the following Kusto query:

      Background -
      <br/>
      City Power &amp; Light company provides electrical infrastructure monitoring solutions for homes and businesses. The company is migrating solutions to Azure.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Current environment -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Architecture overview -
      <br/>
      The company has a public website located at http://www.cpandl.com/. The site is a single-page web application that runs in Azure App Service on Linux. The website uses files stored in Azure Storage and cached in Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve static content.
      <br/>
      API Management and Azure Function App functions are used to process and store data in Azure Database for PostgreSQL. API Management is used to broker communications to the Azure Function app functions for Logic app integration. Logic apps are used to orchestrate the data processing while Service Bus and
      <br/>
      Event Grid handle messaging and events.
      <br/>
      The solution uses Application Insights, Azure Monitor, and Azure Key Vault.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Architecture diagram -
      <br/>
      The company has several applications and services that support their business. The company plans to implement serverless computing where possible. The overall architecture is shown below.

      <br/>
      <br/>
      User authentication -
      <br/>
      The following steps detail the user authentication process:
      <br/>
      1. The user selects Sign in in the website.
      <br/>
      2. The browser redirects the user to the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) sign in page.
      <br/>
      3. The user signs in.
      <br/>
      4. Azure AD redirects the user's session back to the web application. The URL includes an access token.
      <br/>
      5. The web application calls an API and includes the access token in the authentication header. The application ID is sent as the audience (`˜aud') claim in the access token.
      <br/>
      6. The back-end API validates the access token.
      <br/>
      <br/>

      Background -
      <br/>
      You are a developer for Proseware, Inc. You are developing an application that applies a set of governance policies for Proseware's internal services, external services, and applications. The application will also provide a shared library for common functionality.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Requirements -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Policy service -
      <br/>
      You develop and deploy a stateful ASP.NET Core 2.1 web application named Policy service to an Azure App Service Web App. The application reacts to events from Azure Event Grid and performs policy actions based on those events.
      <br/>
      The application must include the Event Grid Event ID field in all Application Insights telemetry.
      <br/>
      Policy service must use Application Insights to automatically scale with the number of policy actions that it is performing.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Policies -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Log policy -
      <br/>
      All Azure App Service Web Apps must write logs to Azure Blob storage. All log files should be saved to a container named logdrop. Logs must remain in the container for 15 days.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Authentication events -
      <br/>
      Authentication events are used to monitor users signing in and signing out. All authentication events must be processed by Policy service. Sign outs must be processed as quickly as possible.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      PolicyLib -
      <br/>
      You have a shared library named PolicyLib that contains functionality common to all ASP.NET Core web services and applications. The PolicyLib library must:
      <br/>
      Exclude non-user actions from Application Insights telemetry.
      <br/>
      Provide methods that allow a web service to scale itself.
      <br/>
      Ensure that scaling actions do not disrupt application usage.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Other -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Anomaly detection service -
      <br/>
      You have an anomaly detection service that analyzes log information for anomalies. It is implemented as an Azure Machine Learning model. The model is deployed as a web service. If an anomaly is detected, an Azure Function that emails administrators is called by using an HTTP WebHook.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Health monitoring -
      <br/>
      All web applications and services have health monitoring at the /health service endpoint.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Issues -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Policy loss -
      <br/>
      When you deploy Policy service, policies may not be applied if they were in the process of being applied during the deployment.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Performance issue -
      <br/>
      When under heavy load, the anomaly detection service undergoes slowdowns and rejects connections.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Notification latency -
      <br/>
      Users report that anomaly detection emails can sometimes arrive several minutes after an anomaly is detected.
      <br/>
      <br/>

      You develop and deploy a stateful ASP.NET Core 2.1 web application named Policy service to an Azure App Service Web App. The application reacts to events from Azure Event Grid and performs policy actions based on those events.
      <br/>
      The application must include the Event Grid Event ID field in all Application Insights telemetry.
      <br/>
      Policy service must use Application Insights to automatically scale with the number of policy actions that it is performing.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Policies -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Log policy -
      <br/>
      All Azure App Service Web Apps must write logs to Azure Blob storage. All log files should be saved to a container named logdrop. Logs must remain in the container for 15 days.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Authentication events -
      <br/>
      Authentication events are used to monitor users signing in and signing out. All authentication events must be processed by Policy service. Sign outs must be processed as quickly as possible.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      PolicyLib -
      <br/>
      You have a shared library named PolicyLib that contains functionality common to all ASP.NET Core web services and applications. The PolicyLib library must:
      <br/>
      Exclude non-user actions from Application Insights telemetry.
      <br/>
      Provide methods that allow a web service to scale itself.
      <br/>
      Ensure that scaling actions do not disrupt application usage.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Other -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Anomaly detection service -
      <br/>
      You have an anomaly detection service that analyzes log information for anomalies. It is implemented as an Azure Machine Learning model. The model is deployed as a web service. If an anomaly is detected, an Azure Function that emails administrators is called by using an HTTP WebHook.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Health monitoring -
      <br/>
      All web applications and services have health monitoring at the /health service endpoint.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Issues -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Policy loss -
      <br/>
      When you deploy Policy service, policies may not be applied if they were in the process of being applied during the deployment.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Performance issue -
      <br/>
      When under heavy load, the anomaly detection service undergoes slowdowns and rejects connections.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Notification latency -
      <br/>
      Users report that anomaly detection emails can sometimes arrive several minutes after an anomaly is detected.

       Application Insights provides three additional data types for custom telemetry:
       <br/>
       Trace - used either directly, or through an adapter to implement diagnostics logging using an instrumentation framework that is familiar to you, such as Log4Net or
       <br/>
       System.Diagnostics.
       <br/>
       Event - typically used to capture user interaction with your service, to analyze usage patterns.
       <br/>
       Metric - used to report periodic scalar measurements.
       <br/>
       Scenario:
       <br/>
       Policy service must use Application Insights to automatically scale with the number of policy actions that it is performing.

      Case study -
      <br/>
      This is a case study. Case studies are not timed separately. You can use as much exam time as you would like to complete each case. However, there may be additional case studies and sections on this exam. You must manage your time to ensure that you are able to complete all questions included on this exam in the time provided.
      <br/>
      To answer the questions included in a case study, you will need to reference information that is provided in the case study. Case studies might contain exhibits and other resources that provide more information about the scenario that is described in the case study. Each question is independent of the other questions in this case study.
      <br/>
      At the end of this case study, a review screen will appear. This screen allows you to review your answers and to make changes before you move to the next section of the exam. After you begin a new section, you cannot return to this section.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      To start the case study -
      <br/>
      To display the first question in this case study, click the Next button. Use the buttons in the left pane to explore the content of the case study before you answer the questions. Clicking these buttons displays information such as business requirements, existing environment, and problem statements. If the case study has an All Information tab, note that the information displayed is identical to the information displayed on the subsequent tabs. When you are ready to answer a question, click the Question button to return to the question.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Background -
      <br/>
      You are a developer for Litware Inc., a SaaS company that provides a solution for managing employee expenses. The solution consists of an ASP.NET Core Web
      <br/>
      API project that is deployed as an Azure Web App.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Overall architecture -
      <br/>
      Employees upload receipts for the system to process. When processing is complete, the employee receives a summary report email that details the processing results. Employees then use a web application to manage their receipts and perform any additional tasks needed for reimbursement.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Receipt processing -
      <br/>
      Employees may upload receipts in two ways:
      <br/>
      Uploading using an Azure Files mounted folder
      <br/>
      Uploading using the web application
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Data Storage -
      <br/>
      Receipt and employee information is stored in an Azure SQL database.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Documentation -
      <br/>
      Employees are provided with a getting started document when they first use the solution. The documentation includes details on supported operating systems for
      <br/>
      Azure File upload, and instructions on how to configure the mounted folder.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Solution details -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Users table -

      <img class="in-exam-image" src="https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03861/0031900001.png"/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Web Application -
      <br/>
      You enable MSI for the Web App and configure the Web App to use the security principal name WebAppIdentity.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Processing -
      <br/>
      Processing is performed by an Azure Function that uses version 2 of the Azure Function runtime. Once processing is completed, results are stored in Azure Blob
      <br/>
      Storage and an Azure SQL database. Then, an email summary is sent to the user with a link to the processing report. The link to the report must remain valid if the email is forwarded to another user.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Logging -
      <br/>
      Azure Application Insights is used for telemetry and logging in both the processor and the web application. The processor also has TraceWriter logging enabled.
      <br/>
      Application Insights must always contain all log messages.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Requirements -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Receipt processing -
      <br/>
      Concurrent processing of a receipt must be prevented.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Disaster recovery -
      <br/>
      Regional outage must not impact application availability. All DR operations must not be dependent on application running and must ensure that data in the DR region is up to date.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Security -
      <br/>
      User's SecurityPin must be stored in such a way that access to the database does not allow the viewing of SecurityPins. The web application is the only system that should have access to SecurityPins.
      <br/>
      All certificates and secrets used to secure data must be stored in Azure Key Vault.
      <br/>
      You must adhere to the principle of least privilege and provide privileges which are essential to perform the intended function.
      <br/>
      All access to Azure Storage and Azure SQL database must use the application's Managed Service Identity (MSI).
      <br/>
      Receipt data must always be encrypted at rest.
      <br/>
      All data must be protected in transit.
      <br/>
      User's expense account number must be visible only to logged in users. All other views of the expense account number should include only the last segment, with the remaining parts obscured.
      <br/>
      In the case of a security breach, access to all summary reports must be revoked without impacting other parts of the system.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Issues -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Upload format issue -
      <br/>
      Employees occasionally report an issue with uploading a receipt using the web application. They report that when they upload a receipt using the Azure File
      <br/>
      Share, the receipt does not appear in their profile. When this occurs, they delete the file in the file share and use the web application, which returns a 500 Internal
      <br/>
      Server error page.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Capacity issue -
      <br/>
      During busy periods, employees report long delays between the time they upload the receipt and when it appears in the web application.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Log capacity issue -
      <br/>
      Developers report that the number of log messages in the trace output for the processor is too high, resulting in lost log messages.

       You can create a snapshot of a blob. A snapshot is a read-only version of a blob that's taken at a point in time. Once a snapshot has been created, it can be read, copied, or deleted, but not modified. Snapshots provide a way to back up a blob as it appears at a moment in time.

      Case study -
      <br/>
      This is a case study. Case studies are not timed separately. You can use as much exam time as you would like to complete each case. However, there may be additional case studies and sections on this exam. You must manage your time to ensure that you are able to complete all questions included on this exam in the time provided.
      <br/>
      To answer the questions included in a case study, you will need to reference information that is provided in the case study. Case studies might contain exhibits and other resources that provide more information about the scenario that is described in the case study. Each question is independent of the other questions in this case study.
      <br/>
      At the end of this case study, a review screen will appear. This screen allows you to review your answers and to make changes before you move to the next section of the exam. After you begin a new section, you cannot return to this section.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      To start the case study -
      <br/>
      To display the first question in this case study, click the Next button. Use the buttons in the left pane to explore the content of the case study before you answer the questions.

      <br/>
      <br/>
      Background -
      <br/>
      You are a developer for Litware Inc., a SaaS company that provides a solution for managing employee expenses. The solution consists of an ASP.NET Core Web
      <br/>
      API project that is deployed as an Azure Web App.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Overall architecture -
      <br/>
      Employees upload receipts for the system to process. When processing is complete, the employee receives a summary report email that details the processing results. Employees then use a web application to manage their receipts and perform any additional tasks needed for reimbursement.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Receipt processing -
      <br/>
      Employees may upload receipts in two ways:
      <br/>
      Uploading using an Azure Files mounted folder
      <br/>
      Uploading using the web application
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Data Storage -
      <br/>
      Receipt and employee information is stored in an Azure SQL database.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Documentation -
      <br/>
      Employees are provided with a getting started document when they first use the solution. The documentation includes details on supported operating systems for
      <br/>
      Azure File upload, and instructions on how to configure the mounted folder.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Solution details -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Users table -
      <br/>
      <img class="in-exam-image" src="https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03861/0031900001.png"/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Web Application -
      <br/>
      You enable MSI for the Web App and configure the Web App to use the security principal name WebAppIdentity.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Processing -
      <br/>
      Processing is performed by an Azure Function that uses version 2 of the Azure Function runtime. Once processing is completed, results are stored in Azure Blob
      <br/>
      Storage and an Azure SQL database. Then, an email summary is sent to the user with a link to the processing report. The link to the report must remain valid if the email is forwarded to another user.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Logging -
      <br/>
      Azure Application Insights is used for telemetry and logging in both the processor and the web application. The processor also has TraceWriter logging enabled.
      <br/>
      Application Insights must always contain all log messages.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Requirements -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Receipt processing -
      <br/>
      Concurrent processing of a receipt must be prevented.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Disaster recovery -
      <br/>
      Regional outage must not impact application availability. All DR operations must not be dependent on application running and must ensure that data in the DR region is up to date.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Security -
      <br/>
      User's SecurityPin must be stored in such a way that access to the database does not allow the viewing of SecurityPins. The web application is the only system that should have access to SecurityPins.
      <br/>
      All certificates and secrets used to secure data must be stored in Azure Key Vault.
      <br/>
      You must adhere to the principle of least privilege and provide privileges which are essential to perform the intended function.
      <br/>
      All access to Azure Storage and Azure SQL database must use the application's Managed Service Identity (MSI).
      <br/>
      Receipt data must always be encrypted at rest.
      <br/>
      All data must be protected in transit.
      <br/>
      User's expense account number must be visible only to logged in users. All other views of the expense account number should include only the last segment, with the remaining parts obscured.
      <br/>
      In the case of a security breach, access to all summary reports must be revoked without impacting other parts of the system.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Issues -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Upload format issue -
      <br/>
      Employees occasionally report an issue with uploading a receipt using the web application. They report that when they upload a receipt using the Azure File
      <br/>
      Share, the receipt does not appear in their profile. When this occurs, they delete the file in the file share and use the web application, which returns a 500 Internal
      <br/>
      Server error page.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Capacity issue -
      <br/>
      During busy periods, employees report long delays between the time they upload the receipt and when it appears in the web application.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Log capacity issue -
      <br/>
      Developers report that the number of log messages in the trace output for the processor is too high, resulting in lost log messages.

       Scenario, the log capacity issue: Developers report that the number of log message in the trace output for the processor is too high, resulting in lost log messages.
       <br/>
       Sampling is a feature in Azure Application Insights. It is the recommended way to reduce telemetry traffic and storage, while preserving a statistically correct analysis of application data. The filter selects items that are related, so that you can navigate between items when you are doing diagnostic investigations. When metric counts are presented to you in the portal, they are renormalized to take account of the sampling, to minimize any effect on the statistics.
       <br/>
       Sampling reduces traffic and data costs, and helps you avoid throttling.

       Scenario: The order workflow fails to run upon initial deployment to Azure.
       <br/>
       Check runs history: Each time that the trigger fires for an item or event, the Logic Apps engine creates and runs a separate workflow instance for each item or event. If a run fails, follow these steps to review what happened during that run, including the status for each step in the workflow plus the inputs and outputs for each step.
       <br/>
       Check the workflow's run status by checking the runs history. To view more information about a failed run, including all the steps in that run in their status, select the failed run.

       Before you can connect to on-premises data sources from Azure Logic Apps, download and install the on-premises data gateway on a local computer. The gateway works as a bridge that provides quick data transfer and encryption between data sources on premises (not in the cloud) and your logic apps.
       <br/>
       The gateway supports BizTalk Server 2016.
       <br/>
       Note: Microsoft have now fully incorporated the Azure BizTalk Services capabilities into Logic Apps and Azure App Service Hybrid Connections.
       <br/>
       Logic Apps Enterprise Integration pack bring some of the enterprise B2B capabilities like AS2 and X12, EDI standards support
       <br/>
       Scenario: The Shipping Logic app must meet the following requirements:
       <br/>
       ✑ Support the ocean transport and inland transport workflows by using a Logic App.
       <br/>
       ✑ Support industry-standard protocol X12 message format for various messages including vessel content details and arrival notices.
       <br/>
       ✑ Secure resources to the corporate VNet and use dedicated storage resources with a fixed costing model.

      <br/>
      Architecture overview -
      <br/>
      The company has a public website located at http://www.cpandl.com/. The site is a single-page web application that runs in Azure App Service on Linux. The website uses files stored in Azure Storage and cached in Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve static content.
      <br/>
      API Management and Azure Function App functions are used to process and store data in Azure Database for PostgreSQL. API Management is used to broker communications to the Azure Function app functions for Logic app integration. Logic apps are used to orchestrate the data processing while Service Bus and
      <br/>
      Event Grid handle messaging and events.
      <br/>
      The solution uses Application Insights, Azure Monitor, and Azure Key Vault.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Architecture diagram -
      <br/>
      The company has several applications and services that support their business. The company plans to implement serverless computing where possible. The overall architecture is shown below.

      <br/>
      Background -
      <br/>
      City Power &amp; Light company provides electrical infrastructure monitoring solutions for homes and businesses. The company is migrating solutions to Azure.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Current environment -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Architecture overview -
      <br/>
      The company has a public website located at http://www.cpandl.com/. The site is a single-page web application that runs in Azure App Service on Linux. The website uses files stored in Azure Storage and cached in Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve static content.
      <br/>
      API Management and Azure Function App functions are used to process and store data in Azure Database for PostgreSQL. API Management is used to broker communications to the Azure Function app functions for Logic app integration. Logic apps are used to orchestrate the data processing while Service Bus and
      <br/>
      Event Grid handle messaging and events.
      <br/>
      The solution uses Application Insights, Azure Monitor, and Azure Key Vault.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Architecture diagram -
      <br/>
      The company has several applications and services that support their business. The company plans to implement serverless computing where possible. The overall architecture is shown below.
      <br/>
      <img class="in-exam-image" src="https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03861/0038400001.png"/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      User authentication -
      <br/>
      The following steps detail the user authentication process:
      <br/>
      1. The user selects Sign in in the website.
      <br/>
      2. The browser redirects the user to the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) sign in page.
      <br/>
      3. The user signs in.
      <br/>
      4. Azure AD redirects the user's session back to the web application. The URL includes an access token.
      <br/>
      5. The web application calls an API and includes the access token in the authentication header. The application ID is sent as the audience (`˜aud') claim in the access token.
      <br/>
      6. The back-end API validates the access token.
      <br/>

       As a solution architect/developer, you should consider using Service Bus queues when:
       <br/>
       ✑ Your solution needs to receive messages without having to poll the queue. With Service Bus, you can achieve it by using a long-polling receive operation using the TCP-based protocols that Service Bus supports.

      <br/>
      <br/>
      Background -
      <br/>
      You are a developer for Proseware, Inc. You are developing an application that applies a set of governance policies for Proseware's internal services, external services, and applications. The application will also provide a shared library for common functionality.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Requirements -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Policy service -
      <br/>
      You develop and deploy a stateful ASP.NET Core 2.1 web application named Policy service to an Azure App Service Web App. The application reacts to events from Azure Event Grid and performs policy actions based on those events.
      <br/>
      The application must include the Event Grid Event ID field in all Application Insights telemetry.
      <br/>
      Policy service must use Application Insights to automatically scale with the number of policy actions that it is performing.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Policies -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Log policy -
      <br/>
      All Azure App Service Web Apps must write logs to Azure Blob storage. All log files should be saved to a container named logdrop. Logs must remain in the container for 15 days.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Authentication events -
      <br/>
      Authentication events are used to monitor users signing in and signing out. All authentication events must be processed by Policy service. Sign outs must be processed as quickly as possible.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      PolicyLib -
      <br/>
      You have a shared library named PolicyLib that contains functionality common to all ASP.NET Core web services and applications. The PolicyLib library must:
      <br/>
      Exclude non-user actions from Application Insights telemetry.
      <br/>
      Provide methods that allow a web service to scale itself.
      <br/>
      Ensure that scaling actions do not disrupt application usage.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Other -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Anomaly detection service -
      <br/>
      You have an anomaly detection service that analyzes log information for anomalies. It is implemented as an Azure Machine Learning model. The model is deployed as a web service. If an anomaly is detected, an Azure Function that emails administrators is called by using an HTTP WebHook.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Health monitoring -
      <br/>
      All web applications and services have health monitoring at the /health service endpoint.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Issues -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Policy loss -
      <br/>
      When you deploy Policy service, policies may not be applied if they were in the process of being applied during the deployment.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Performance issue -
      <br/>
      When under heavy load, the anomaly detection service undergoes slowdowns and rejects connections.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Notification latency -
      <br/>
      Users report that anomaly detection emails can sometimes arrive several minutes after an anomaly is detected.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      App code -

      Case study -
      <br/>
      This is a case study. Case studies are not timed separately. You can use as much exam time as you would like to complete each case. However, there may be additional case studies and sections on this exam. You must manage your time to ensure that you are able to complete all questions included on this exam in the time provided.
      <br/>
      To answer the questions included in a case study, you will need to reference information that is provided in the case study. Case studies might contain exhibits and other resources that provide more information about the scenario that is described in the case study. Each question is independent of the other questions in this case study.
      <br/>
      At the end of this case study, a review screen will appear. This screen allows you to review your answers and to make changes before you move to the next section of the exam. After you begin a new section, you cannot return to this section.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      To start the case study -
      <br/>
      To display the first question in this case study, click the Next button. Use the buttons in the left pane to explore the content of the case study before you answer the questions. Clicking these buttons displays information such as business requirements, existing environment, and problem statements. When you are ready to answer a question, click the Question button to return to the question.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Background -
      <br/>
      You are a developer for Proseware, Inc. You are developing an application that applies a set of governance policies for Proseware's internal services, external services, and applications. The application will also provide a shared library for common functionality.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Requirements -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Policy service -
      <br/>
      You develop and deploy a stateful ASP.NET Core 2.1 web application named Policy service to an Azure App Service Web App. The application reacts to events from Azure Event Grid and performs policy actions based on those events.
      <br/>
      The application must include the Event Grid Event ID field in all Application Insights telemetry.
      <br/>
      Policy service must use Application Insights to automatically scale with the number of policy actions that it is performing.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Policies -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Log policy -
      <br/>
      All Azure App Service Web Apps must write logs to Azure Blob storage. All log files should be saved to a container named logdrop. Logs must remain in the container for 15 days.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Authentication events -
      <br/>
      Authentication events are used to monitor users signing in and signing out. All authentication events must be processed by Policy service. Sign outs must be processed as quickly as possible.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      PolicyLib -
      <br/>
      You have a shared library named PolicyLib that contains functionality common to all ASP.NET Core web services and applications. The PolicyLib library must:
      <br/>
      Exclude non-user actions from Application Insights telemetry.
      <br/>
      Provide methods that allow a web service to scale itself.
      <br/>
      Ensure that scaling actions do not disrupt application usage.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Other -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Anomaly detection service -
      <br/>
      You have an anomaly detection service that analyzes log information for anomalies. It is implemented as an Azure Machine Learning model. The model is deployed as a web service. If an anomaly is detected, an Azure Function that emails administrators is called by using an HTTP WebHook.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Health monitoring -
      <br/>
      All web applications and services have health monitoring at the /health service endpoint.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Issues -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Policy loss -
      <br/>
      When you deploy Policy service, policies may not be applied if they were in the process of being applied during the deployment.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Performance issue -
      <br/>
      When under heavy load, the anomaly detection service undergoes slowdowns and rejects connections.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Notification latency -
      <br/>
      Users report that anomaly detection emails can sometimes arrive several minutes after an anomaly is detected.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      App code -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      EventGridController.cs -
      <br/>
      Relevant portions of the app files are shown below. Line numbers are included for reference only and include a two-character prefix that denotes the specific file to which they belong.

       Azure Functions can run on either a Consumption Plan or a dedicated App Service Plan. If you run in a dedicated mode, you need to turn on the Always On setting for your Function App to run properly. The Function runtime will go idle after a few minutes of inactivity, so only HTTP triggers will actually "wake up" your functions. This is similar to how WebJobs must have Always On enabled.
       <br/>
       Scenario: Notification latency: Users report that anomaly detection emails can sometimes arrive several minutes after an anomaly is detected.

       Anomaly detection service: You have an anomaly detection service that analyzes log information for anomalies. It is implemented as an Azure Machine Learning model. The model is deployed as a web service.

      <br/>
      <br/>
      Background -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Overview -
      <br/>
      You are a developer for Contoso, Ltd. The company has a social networking website that is developed as a Single Page Application (SPA). The main web application for the social networking website loads user uploaded content from blob storage.
      <br/>
      You are developing a solution to monitor uploaded data for inappropriate content. The following process occurs when users upload content by using the SPA:
      <br/>
      Messages are sent to ContentUploadService.
      <br/>
      Content is processed by ContentAnalysisService.
      <br/>
      After processing is complete, the content is posted to the social network or a rejection message is posted in its place.
      <br/>
      The ContentAnalysisService is deployed with Azure Container Instances from a private Azure Container Registry named contosoimages.
      <br/>
      The solution will use eight CPU cores.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Azure Active Directory -
      <br/>
      Contoso, Ltd. uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for both internal and guest accounts.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Requirements -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      ContentAnalysisService -
      <br/>
      The company's data science group built ContentAnalysisService which accepts user generated content as a string and returns a probable value for inappropriate content. Any values over a specific threshold must be reviewed by an employee of Contoso, Ltd.
      <br/>
      You must create an Azure Function named CheckUserContent to perform the content checks.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Costs -
      <br/>
      You must minimize costs for all Azure services.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Manual review -
      <br/>
      To review content, the user must authenticate to the website portion of the ContentAnalysisService using their Azure AD credentials. The website is built using
      <br/>
      React and all pages and API endpoints require authentication. In order to review content a user must be part of a ContentReviewer role. All completed reviews must include the reviewer's email address for auditing purposes.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      High availability -
      <br/>
      All services must run in multiple regions. The failure of any service in a region must not impact overall application availability.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Monitoring -
      <br/>
      An alert must be raised if the ContentUploadService uses more than 80 percent of available CPU cores.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Security -
      <br/>
      You have the following security requirements:
      <br/>
      Any web service accessible over the Internet must be protected from cross site scripting attacks.
      <br/>
      All websites and services must use SSL from a valid root certificate authority.
      <br/>
      Azure Storage access keys must only be stored in memory and must be available only to the service.
      <br/>
      All Internal services must only be accessible from internal Virtual Networks (VNets).
      <br/>
      All parts of the system must support inbound and outbound traffic restrictions.
      <br/>
      All service calls must be authenticated by using Azure AD.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      User agreements -
      <br/>
      When a user submits content, they must agree to a user agreement. The agreement allows employees of Contoso, Ltd. to review content, store cookies on user devices, and track user's IP addresses.
      <br/>
      Information regarding agreements is used by multiple divisions within Contoso, Ltd.
      <br/>
      User responses must not be lost and must be available to all parties regardless of individual service uptime. The volume of agreements is expected to be in the millions per hour.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Validation testing -
      <br/>
      When a new version of the ContentAnalysisService is available the previous seven days of content must be processed with the new version to verify that the new version does not significantly deviate from the old version.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Issues -
      <br/>
      Users of the ContentUploadService report that they occasionally see HTTP 502 responses on specific pages.

       Scenario:
       <br/>
       You must minimize costs for all Azure services.
       <br/>
       All Internal services must only be accessible from internal Virtual Networks (VNets).
       <br/>
       Best for long-running scenarios where Durable Functions can't be used. Consider an App Service plan in the following situations:
       <br/>
       ✑ You have existing, underutilized VMs that are already running other App Service instances.
       <br/>
       ✑ You want to provide a custom image on which to run your functions.
       <br/>
       ✑ Predictive scaling and costs are required.
       <br/>
       Note: When you create a function app in Azure, you must choose a hosting plan for your app. There are three basic hosting plans available for Azure Functions:
       <br/>
       Consumption plan, Premium plan, and Dedicated (App Service) plan.
       <br/>
       Incorrect Answers:
       <br/>
       A: A Premium plan would be more costly.
       <br/>
       C: Need the VNET functionality.

       Step 1: Build a new application image by using dockerfile

       Step 2: Create an alias if the image with the fully qualified path to the registry
       <br/>
       Before you can push the image to a private registry, youג€™ve to ensure a proper image name. This can be achieved using the docker tag command. For demonstration purpose, weג€™ll use Dockerג€™s hello world image, rename it and push it to ACR.
       <br/>
       # pulls hello-world from the public docker hub
       <br/>

       Step 3: Log in to the registry and push image
       <br/>
       In order to push images to the newly created ACR instance, you need to login to ACR form the Docker CLI. Once logged in, you can push any existing docker image to your ACR instance.

      <br/>
      Background -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Overview -
      <br/>
      You are a developer for Contoso, Ltd. The company has a social networking website that is developed as a Single Page Application (SPA). The main web application for the social networking website loads user uploaded content from blob storage.
      <br/>
      You are developing a solution to monitor uploaded data for inappropriate content. The following process occurs when users upload content by using the SPA:
      <br/>
      * Messages are sent to ContentUploadService.
      <br/>
      * Content is processed by ContentAnalysisService.
      <br/>
      * After processing is complete, the content is posted to the social network or a rejection message is posted in its place.
      <br/>
      The ContentAnalysisService is deployed with Azure Container Instances from a private Azure Container Registry named contosoimages.
      <br/>
      The solution will use eight CPU cores.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Azure Active Directory -
      <br/>
      Contoso, Ltd. uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for both internal and guest accounts.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Requirements -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      ContentAnalysisService -
      <br/>
      The company's data science group built ContentAnalysisService which accepts user generated content as a string and returns a probable value for inappropriate content. Any values over a specific threshold must be reviewed by an employee of Contoso, Ltd.
      <br/>
      You must create an Azure Function named CheckUserContent to perform the content checks.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Costs -
      <br/>
      You must minimize costs for all Azure services.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Manual review -
      <br/>
      To review content, the user must authenticate to the website portion of the ContentAnalysisService using their Azure AD credentials. The website is built using
      <br/>
      React and all pages and API endpoints require authentication. In order to review content a user must be part of a ContentReviewer role. All completed reviews must include the reviewer's email address for auditing purposes.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      High availability -
      <br/>
      All services must run in multiple regions. The failure of any service in a region must not impact overall application availability.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Monitoring -
      <br/>
      An alert must be raised if the ContentUploadService uses more than 80 percent of available CPU cores.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Security -
      <br/>
      You have the following security requirements:
      <br/>
      Any web service accessible over the Internet must be protected from cross site scripting attacks.
      <br/>
      All websites and services must use SSL from a valid root certificate authority.
      <br/>
      Azure Storage access keys must only be stored in memory and must be available only to the service.
      <br/>
      All Internal services must only be accessible from internal Virtual Networks (VNets).
      <br/>
      All parts of the system must support inbound and outbound traffic restrictions.
      <br/>
      All service calls must be authenticated by using Azure AD.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      User agreements -
      <br/>
      When a user submits content, they must agree to a user agreement. The agreement allows employees of Contoso, Ltd. to review content, store cookies on user devices, and track user's IP addresses.
      <br/>
      Information regarding agreements is used by multiple divisions within Contoso, Ltd.
      <br/>
      User responses must not be lost and must be available to all parties regardless of individual service uptime. The volume of agreements is expected to be in the millions per hour.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Validation testing -
      <br/>
      When a new version of the ContentAnalysisService is available the previous seven days of content must be processed with the new version to verify that the new version does not significantly deviate from the old version.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Issues -
      <br/>
      Users of the ContentUploadService report that they occasionally see HTTP 502 responses on specific pages.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Code -
      <br/>
      <br/>

      <br/>
      React and all pages and API endpoints require authentication. In order to review content a user must be part of a ContentReviewer role. All completed reviews must include the reviewer's email address for auditing purposes.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      High availability -
      <br/>
      All services must run in multiple regions. The failure of any service in a region must not impact overall application availability.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Monitoring -
      <br/>
      An alert must be raised if the ContentUploadService uses more than 80 percent of available CPU cores.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Security -
      <br/>
      You have the following security requirements:
      <br/>
      Any web service accessible over the Internet must be protected from cross site scripting attacks.
      <br/>
      All websites and services must use SSL from a valid root certificate authority.
      <br/>

       Box 2: [Blob(..)]
       <br/>
       Azure Blob storage output binding for Azure Functions. The output binding allows you to modify and delete blob storage data in an Azure Function.
       <br/>
       The attribute's constructor takes the path to the blob and a FileAccess parameter indicating read or write, as shown in the following example:
       <br/>
       [FunctionName("ResizeImage")]
       <br/>
       public static void Run(
       <br/>
       [BlobTrigger("sample-images/{name}")] Stream image,
       <br/>
       [Blob("sample-images-md/{name}", FileAccess.Write)] Stream imageSmall)
       <br/>
       {
       <br/>
       ...
       <br/>
       }
       <br/>
       Scenario: You must create an Azure Function named CheckUserContent to perform the content checks.
       <br/>
       The companyג€™s data science group built ContentAnalysisService which accepts user generated content as a string and returns a probable value for inappropriate content. Any values over a specific threshold must be reviewed by an employee of Contoso, Ltd.

      Background -
      <br/>
      City Power &amp; Light company provides electrical infrastructure monitoring solutions for homes and businesses. The company is migrating solutions to Azure.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Current environment -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Architecture overview -
      <br/>
      The company has a public website located at http://www.cpandl.com/. The site is a single-page web application that runs in Azure App Service on Linux. The website uses files stored in Azure Storage and cached in Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve static content.
      <br/>
      API Management and Azure Function App functions are used to process and store data in Azure Database for PostgreSQL. API Management is used to broker communications to the Azure Function app functions for Logic app integration. Logic apps are used to orchestrate the data processing while Service Bus and
      <br/>
      Event Grid handle messaging and events.
      <br/>
      The solution uses Application Insights, Azure Monitor, and Azure Key Vault.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Architecture diagram -
      <br/>
      The company has several applications and services that support their business. The company plans to implement serverless computing where possible. The overall architecture is shown below.
      <br/>
      <img class="in-exam-image" src="https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03861/0011300001.png"/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      User authentication -
      <br/>
      The following steps detail the user authentication process:
      <br/>
      1. The user selects Sign in in the website.
      <br/>
      2. The browser redirects the user to the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) sign in page.
      <br/>
      3. The user signs in.
      <br/>
      4. Azure AD redirects the user's session back to the web application. The URL includes an access token.
      <br/>
      5. The web application calls an API and includes the access token in the authentication header. The application ID is sent as the audience (`˜aud') claim in the access token.
      <br/>
      6. The back-end API validates the access token.
      <br/>
      <br/>

       Account Kind: StorageV2 (general-purpose v2)
       <br/>
       Scenario: Azure Storage blob will be used (refer to the exhibit). Data storage costs must be minimized.
       <br/>
       General-purpose v2 accounts: Basic storage account type for blobs, files, queues, and tables. Recommended for most scenarios using Azure Storage.
       <br/>
       Incorrect Answers:
       <br/>
       ✑ BlockBlobStorage accounts: Storage accounts with premium performance characteristics for block blobs and append blobs. Recommended for scenarios with high transactions rates, or scenarios that use smaller objects or require consistently low storage latency.
       <br/>
       ✑ General-purpose v1 accounts: Legacy account type for blobs, files, queues, and tables. Use general-purpose v2 accounts instead when possible.
       <br/>
       Replication: Geo-redundant Storage
       <br/>
       Scenario: Data must be replicated to a secondary region and three availability zones.
       <br/>
       Geo-redundant storage (GRS) copies your data synchronously three times within a single physical location in the primary region using LRS. It then copies your data asynchronously to a single physical location in the secondary region.
       <br/>
       Incorrect Answers:
       <br/>
       Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS), but it would be more costly.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Storage tier: Cool -
       <br/>
       Data storage costs must be minimized.
       <br/>
       Note: Azure storage offers different access tiers, which allow you to store blob object data in the most cost-effective manner. The available access tiers include:
       <br/>
       Hot - Optimized for storing data that is accessed frequently.
       <br/>
       Cool - Optimized for storing data that is infrequently accessed and stored for at least 30 days.

      <br/>
      Background -
      <br/>
      You are a developer for Litware Inc., a SaaS company that provides a solution for managing employee expenses. The solution consists of an ASP.NET Core Web
      <br/>
      API project that is deployed as an Azure Web App.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Overall architecture -
      <br/>
      Employees upload receipts for the system to process. When processing is complete, the employee receives a summary report email that details the processing results. Employees then use a web application to manage their receipts and perform any additional tasks needed for reimbursement.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Receipt processing -
      <br/>
      Employees may upload receipts in two ways:
      <br/>
      Uploading using an Azure Files mounted folder
      <br/>
      Uploading using the web application
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Data Storage -
      <br/>
      Receipt and employee information is stored in an Azure SQL database.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Documentation -
      <br/>
      Employees are provided with a getting started document when they first use the solution. The documentation includes details on supported operating systems for
      <br/>
      Azure File upload, and instructions on how to configure the mounted folder.
      <br/>
      <br/>

      <img class="in-exam-image" src="https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03861/0012100001.png"/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Web Application -
      <br/>
      You enable MSI for the Web App and configure the Web App to use the security principal name WebAppIdentity.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Processing -
      <br/>
      Processing is performed by an Azure Function that uses version 2 of the Azure Function runtime. Once processing is completed, results are stored in Azure Blob
      <br/>
      Storage and an Azure SQL database. Then, an email summary is sent to the user with a link to the processing report. The link to the report must remain valid if the email is forwarded to another user.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Logging -
      <br/>
      Azure Application Insights is used for telemetry and logging in both the processor and the web application. The processor also has TraceWriter logging enabled.
      <br/>
      Application Insights must always contain all log messages.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Requirements -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Receipt processing -
      <br/>
      Concurrent processing of a receipt must be prevented.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Disaster recovery -

      Case study -
      <br/>
      This is a case study. Case studies are not timed separately. You can use as much exam time as you would like to complete each case. However, there may be additional case studies and sections on this exam. You must manage your time to ensure that you are able to complete all questions included on this exam in the time provided.
      <br/>
      To answer the questions included in a case study, you will need to reference information that is provided in the case study. Case studies might contain exhibits and other resources that provide more information about the scenario that is described in the case study. Each question is independent of the other questions in this case study.
      <br/>
      At the end of this case study, a review screen will appear. This screen allows you to review your answers and to make changes before you move to the next section of the exam. After you begin a new section, you cannot return to this section.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      To start the case study -
      <br/>
      To display the first question in this case study, click the Next button. Use the buttons in the left pane to explore the content of the case study before you answer the questions. Clicking these buttons displays information such as business requirements, existing environment, and problem statements. When you are ready to answer a question, click the Question button to return to the question.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Background -
      <br/>
      You are a developer for Litware Inc., a SaaS company that provides a solution for managing employee expenses. The solution consists of an ASP.NET Core Web
      <br/>
      API project that is deployed as an Azure Web App.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Overall architecture -
      <br/>
      Employees upload receipts for the system to process. When processing is complete, the employee receives a summary report email that details the processing results. Employees then use a web application to manage their receipts and perform any additional tasks needed for reimbursement.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Receipt processing -
      <br/>
      Employees may upload receipts in two ways:
      <br/>
      Uploading using an Azure Files mounted folder
      <br/>
      Uploading using the web application
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Data Storage -
      <br/>
      Receipt and employee information is stored in an Azure SQL database.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Documentation -
      <br/>
      Employees are provided with a getting started document when they first use the solution. The documentation includes details on supported operating systems for
      <br/>
      Azure File upload, and instructions on how to configure the mounted folder.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Solution details -

      <br/>
      <br/>
      Web Application -
      <br/>
      You enable MSI for the Web App and configure the Web App to use the security principal name WebAppIdentity.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Processing -
      <br/>
      Processing is performed by an Azure Function that uses version 2 of the Azure Function runtime. Once processing is completed, results are stored in Azure Blob
      <br/>
      Storage and an Azure SQL database. Then, an email summary is sent to the user with a link to the processing report. The link to the report must remain valid if the email is forwarded to another user.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Logging -
      <br/>
      Azure Application Insights is used for telemetry and logging in both the processor and the web application. The processor also has TraceWriter logging enabled.
      <br/>
      Application Insights must always contain all log messages.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Requirements -
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Receipt processing -
      <br/>
      Concurrent processing of a receipt must be prevented.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Disaster recovery -
      <br/>
      Regional outage must not impact application availability. All DR operations must not be dependent on application running and must ensure that data in the DR region is up to date.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Security -
      <br/>
      User's SecurityPin must be stored in such a way that access to the database does not allow the viewing of SecurityPins. The web application is the only system that should have access to SecurityPins.

      <br/>
      All access to Azure Storage and Azure SQL database must use the application's Managed Service Identity (MSI).
      <br/>
      Receipt data must always be encrypted at rest.
      <br/>
      All data must be protected in transit.
      <br/>
      User's expense account number must be visible only to logged in users. All other views of the expense account number should include only the last segment, with the remaining parts obscured.
      <br/>
      In the case of a security breach, access to all summary reports must be revoked without impacting other parts of the system.
      <br/>

       Box 1: Strong -
       <br/>
       When the consistency level is set to strong, the staleness window is equivalent to zero, and the clients are guaranteed to read the latest committed value of the write operation.
       <br/>
       Scenario: Changes to the Order data must reflect immediately across all partitions. All reads to the Order data must fetch the most recent writes.
       <br/>
       Note: You can choose from five well-defined models on the consistency spectrum. From strongest to weakest, the models are: Strong, Bounded staleness,
       <br/>
       Session, Consistent prefix, Eventual

      Coho Winery produces, bottles, and distributes a variety of wines globally. You are a developer implementing highly scalable and resilient applications to support online order processing by using Azure solutions.
      <br/>
      Coho Winery has a LabelMaker application that prints labels for wine bottles. The application sends data to several printers. The application consists of five modules that run independently on virtual machines (VMs). Coho Winery plans to move the application to Azure and continue to support label creation.
      <br/>
      External partners send data to the LabelMaker application to include artwork and text for custom label designs.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Requirements. Data -
      <br/>
      You identify the following requirements for data management and manipulation:
      <br/>
      Order data is stored as nonrelational JSON and must be queried using SQL.
      <br/>
      Changes to the Order data must reflect immediately across all partitions. All reads to the Order data must fetch the most recent writes.
      <br/>

      <br/>
      External partners must use their own credentials and authenticate with their organization's identity management solution.
      <br/>
      External partner logins must be audited monthly for application use by a user account administrator to maintain company compliance.
      <br/>
      Storage of e-commerce application settings must be maintained in Azure Key Vault.
      <br/>
      E-commerce application sign-ins must be secured by using Azure App Service authentication and Azure Active Directory (AAD).
      <br/>
      Conditional access policies must be applied at the application level to protect company content.
      <br/>
      The LabelMaker application must be secured by using an AAD account that has full access to all namespaces of the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Requirements. LabelMaker app -
      <br/>
      Azure Monitor Container Health must be used to monitor the performance of workloads that are deployed to Kubernetes environments and hosted on Azure
      <br/>
      Kubernetes Service (AKS).

      Issues -
      <br/>
      Calls to the Printer API App fail periodically due to printer communication timeouts.
      <br/>
      Printer communication timeouts occur after 10 seconds. The label printer must only receive up to 5 attempts within one minute.
      <br/>
      The order workflow fails to run upon initial deployment to Azure.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Order.json -
      <br/>
      Relevant portions of the app files are shown below. Line numbers are included for reference only.
